                 new techniques on the printing industry. A selection of

                 sectional headings to illustrate the range and volume
                 of possible development. The use of data banks to
                 provide a source of copy for the production of varied

                 image to appear on the CRT, and also the movement of
                 the film in the camera. The tape is read into a control
                 processor which, in turn, drives a CRT\slash camera
                 unit. Images generated on the CRT are directly
                 transferred to film or photographic paper through a
                 fixed-lens system. Through the successful marriage of
                 hard and soft logic, graphic arts quality images can be
                 typeset in an infinite variety of type styles and page

  abstract =     "Expansion of typewriter composition and the shift from
                 letter press to sheet-fed offset and web-offset
                 printing are two major developments that are lowering
                 costs and improving the efficiency of the overall
                 publishing operation at the American Institute of
                 Physics (AIP). In 1972, out of a total of 104,000 text
                 pages published by AIP and its member societies, about
                 69,000 pages, or 66 percent, were typewriter composed.
                 Typewriter composition of scientific articles was
                 pioneered by S. A. Goudsmit, Editor-in-Chief of the
                 American Physical Society, for Physical Review Letters.
                 This weekly publication has been typewriter composed
                 since 1958. Today, about 11\,000 pages for Physical
                 Review C and Physical Review D are typewriter composed
                 at AIP's new publishing facility at Brookhaven National
                 Laboratory. Another 8000 pages mainly for Applied
                 Physics Letters and the Journal of Applied Physics are
                 produced by our Publications Division Composition
                 Section in New York City. A small fraction of the total
                 is composed to AIP specifications by the authors
                 themselves. Outside contractors handle the remaining
                 typewriter composition including all of the Russian
                 translation journals. The main justification for the
                 switch from monotype to typewriter composition is the
                 resulting savings of 20 to 30 percent in composition
                 cost Depending upon the journal and the compositor
                 used, these savings amount to as much as \$10 per page.
                 In addition, the close coupling of copy editing,
                 composition, proofreading, and page makeup that is
                 possible with an in-house typewriter composition
                 operation has shortened publication time by as much as
                 2 weeks out of a total of 3 months. We will describe
                 the AIP typewriter composition system from copy
                 editing, through the composition of galleys, to page
                 makeup and the production of final camera-ready copy
                 for offset printing. Specially modified IBM Executive
                 proportional-spacing electric typewriters, equipped
                 with unique attachments, permit the use of a wide
                 range- of special characters and signs (italic, Greek,
                 mathematical symbols, superscripts, etc.) needed to
                 compose scientific articles.",

                 make a compiler that translates this language into
                 typesetting commands. Output may be produced on either
                 a phototypesetter or on a terminal with forward and
                 reverse half-line motions. The system interfaces
                 directly with text formatting programs, so mixtures of

                 favors the computer only if multiple use can be made of
                 the material after it has been captured in
                 machine-readable form. Such is the case with the
                 material that is keyboarded into the bibliographic
                 database of the American Institute of Physics (AIP).
                 The records in this database are produced directly from
                 the manuscripts submitted by authors and are then used
                 over and over again. The multiple-use concept cannot be
                 used to justify computer typesetting of the full text
                 of journal articles. The paper describes such multiple

                 can become competitive with other methods.",

                 the appearance of text in order to provide a visual
                 distinction between different levels of text content.
                 An experiment is reported in which three cueing
                 conditions were compared. One format used capitals for
                 the cued material, a second used bold setting, and the
                 third was control condition. In an attempt to determine
                 the influence of providing a pre-test on the outcome of
                 cueing experiments, three pre-testing conditions were
                 provided: pre-test of cued information, of noncued
                 information, no pre-test. Subjects read a passage for 3
                 min, and were then given separate tests of cued and
                 noncued information. The results of the test of cued
                 information are interpreted as supporting the
                 hypothesis that cueing yields higher scores if a
                 pre-test of cued information or no pre-test has been
                 administered. It seems that with capital cueing, the
                 benefit on the test of cued information is
                 counter-balanced by a decline in the test of uncued
                 information. As such a trade-off did not occur with the
                 bold cueing, this would seem a preferable format.",

                 composition, real-time performance and music
                 typesetting. The system permits the input of sounded
                 music and its subsequent playback using an electronic
                 organ. Facilities for transcription, display and
                 editing are provided using a graphical display unit. A
                 digital synthesizer is incorporated for sophisticated
                 sound generation. Problems encountered with
                 transcription, display and editing of sounded music are
                 identified. A performance-oriented music notation is
                 described, and compared with conventional music
                 notation. The requirements of both notations are
                 assessed with respect to the transcription, display and
                 editing tasks. The value of an interactive rather than
                 fully automatic system is emphasized. Software and
                 data-base organization of a transcription system
                 permitting the display and editing of both notations is
                 described. Results are presented of practical uses of
                 the system.",

                 printer by the method of moving the print mechanism or
                 character font. A character printer moves the printhead
                 across the paper a single column at a time. The line
                 printer moves the entire character set past the impact
                 hammers in a vertical (drum) or horizontal (band-train)
                 format. The print mechanism contains one hammer per
                 column of print position. The printable character set
                 is scanned past the hammers at a constant velocity.
                 When a character reaches the column to be printed with
                 that character, the printer control causes the hammer
                 to impact the character at that column. This can only
                 be achieved by the character set speed being controlled
                 in a synchronous or constant-speed mode. The intent of
                 this paper is to present the motor selection process

                 with some people: it is seen as nothing better than
                 mere typewritten copy; really professional work should
                 be ``blocked out'', justified. The author argues that
                 such a view is the product of closed minds, and shows
                 that there are significant advantages to leaving the
                 right edge ragged. Examples are given of the same
                 paragraph: (1) set in traditional justified
                 (blocked-out) style; (2) set to the same column width,
                 but unjustified and without end-of-line hyphens,
                 resulting in one additional line of type; (3) set in a
                 column one-half -pica wider, set ``tight-ragged'', with
                 hyphenation reduced but not completely eliminated, with
                 word spacing that is even; the number of lines is the
                 same as the original justified version. Examples (1)
                 through (3) are set ``flush left'', as is normally the
                 case. Example (4) is set ``flush right, ragged left'',
                 the reverse of (2); reduced legibility results because
                 a vertical reference line on the left is missing,
                 requiring the eye to search for the beginning of each
                 new line. Example (5) is set ``ragged right and left''
                 (centered); again legibility is reduced because the
                 vertical reference line on the left is missing. The
                 author recommends the setting of Example (3) for
                 legibility and economy in number of lines.",

                 technicalities of computer usage. It is important,

                 learning to do. Factors such as flexibility of style
                 specification and economical proof generation are
                 important from a user's point of view. On the other

                 independence and system portability are points of

                 is usually attributed to the distinctive shape of lower

                 capital letters at the start of sentences and for

  abstract =     "For over seventy-five years the University of Chicago
                 Press `Manual of Style' has been the standard reference
                 tool for authors, editors, copywriters, and
                 proofreaders. Updated many times since 1906, it now
                 goes into its thirteenth edition---the first to
                 introduce a change in title. Bowing to what has become
                 nearly universal usage, we now call the `Manual' what
                 everybody else calls it, `The Chicago Manual of
                 Style'---or, for short, `The Chicago Manual'.\par Two
                 pervasive features characterize the present edition: it
                 reflects the impact of the new technology on the entire
                 editing and publishing process, and it spells out, in
                 greater detail and with many more examples, the
                 procedures with which it deals. It is, in short, much
                 more a ``how-to'' book for authors and editors than was
                 its predecessor. In chapter 2, on manuscript
                 preparation and copyediting, for example, new sections
                 have been added on how to mark a manuscript and how to
                 mark type specifications on a script. Chapter 12
                 (``Tables''), completely rewritten, begins with advice
                 on how to make a table from raw data. Chapters 15
                 through 17, on documentation, have been reorganized and
                 greatly expanded, offering many more alternative
                 methods of citation and a wealth of examples. In
                 chapter 18 (``Indexes''), clear step-by-step procedures
                 for the mechanics of index making are set forth. The
                 terminology and methodology of technological advances
                 (in word processing, computerized electronic
                 typesetting, and the like) are reflected most
                 prominently in chapter 20, ``Composition, Printing, and
                 Binding'' (new to this edition), and in the Glossary.
                 Other notable features of the present edition are
                 chapter 4 (``Rights and Permissions''), rewritten in
                 light of the new copyright law, and chapter 9
                 (``Foreign Languages''), which includes a new table of
                 dicritics, a pinyin (Chinese) conversion chart and data
                 on several more languages.\par Throughout, `The Chicago
                 Manual' aims to give clear and straightforward
                 guidelines for preparing and editing copy---with the
                 emphasis on the sensible, the practical, and the
                 economical. As did its predecessors, the thirteenth
                 edition of the `Manual' states the style preferences of
                 the University of Chicago Press and reflects the
                 current practices and requirements of the great
                 majority of American publishers.",

                 study of the correlation between picture elements, it

                 on three neighboring screen dots. Based on this
                 finding, an adaptive predictive split coding method is
                 developed which predicts and encodes screen dot image
                 data and character image data according to the most
                 adaptive reference picture elements. This coding method

                 prevent reduction of the compression factor when
                 different kinds of data are used. It proves to be a

                 separation and laser dot generating, laser printing,
                 laser gravure, laser plate making, etc. Application of
                 laser technology in the area of security printers had a
                 rather slow start but is speeding up rapidly. Encoding
                 credit cards by laser and holography are examples of
                 the application of lasers in this field. We summarize
                 known industrial applications of lasers in the graphic
                 industries and report about the applications of lasers
                 in the detection of a coded watermark. A step repeat

                 bidirectional, dot-matrix impact printers. Common to
                 the family is the ability to print at 200 characters
                 per second (cps) on one-to-six-part forms up to 400 mm
                 (15. 75 inches) wide. The standard symbol font is
                 designed to a 9 multiplied by 12 symbol cell matrix,
                 with a horizontal and vertical resolution of 90 dots
                 per inch (dpi). All three of the printers have the
                 ability to print graphics at 21,600 dots per second.
                 There are two standard character styles resident in all
                 the printers --- Courier (serif) and Cubic (sans
                 serif). In addition, there are three standard pitches
                 and ten resident languages, all of which can be
                 selected from the printer's front panel or under host

                 described that has been developed as a subprogram of
                 the HPWord word processing software for HP 3000
                 Computer Systems. HPWord has multilingual capabilities,
                 that is, documents can be produced in different
                 languages. This affects some layout features as well as
                 the hyphenation of words, which is done automatically.
                 The main advantage of the algorithm is its flexibility;
                 the linguistic rules can be changed without changing
                 the program. This makes it possible to use the program
                 for other languages as well. The same program is being
                 implemented in the Danish version of HPWord. It can
                 also be implemented easily in other text processing
                 programs. It is, for instance, easy to convert he the
                 algorithm to other programming languages such as
                 Pascal. Moreover, the problem of efficiency and of
                 hierarchy in the linguistic rules has been completely
                 solved by using a tree structure and an extra data
                 segment to store all linguistic rules. This way

                 hyphenated according to rules about sequences of vowels
                 and consonants; compound words and words with prefixes
                 are split into their components. The algorithm
                 distinguishes main hyphenation points between
                 independent parts of the compound and minor points
                 within these components. Some words may be split in
                 more than one way; every such ambiguity is discovered.
                 By refusing these `unsafe' words, the algorithm becomes
                 resistant against wrong hyphenation. The method uses a

                 producing documents in an office environment and have
                 been readily accepted as a replacement for the
                 typewriter. Along with WP has come the opportunity to
                 create typesetting from a WP --- with interfacing being
                 the facilitating link. Book publishers, associations,
                 colleges and universities, corporations, government
                 bodies and financial institutions are all making the
                 move to electronic manuscripts due to the savings in
                 time and costs. Unfortunately, only a small proportion
                 of the output from a WP is printed\slash typeset, most
                 of it is photocopied which further reduces the quality
                 of the finished product. In parallel with the
                 automation of typewriting, printing had become
                 automated; influenced and driven by the changing
                 requirements of the publishing industry. There are now
                 opportunities for bringing together the two

                 of the automated office. This paper introduces the
                 concepts of interfacing the two technologies as well as
                 providing a brief overview of phototypesetting plus

                 the discrimination stage. The recognition speed is more
                 than 100 characters per second for a 2300-character

                 briefly discussing some possible ways of approaching
                 the issue. Then the implementation of the WYSIWYG
                 system on Apple's Lisa computer will be used as the
                 vehicle to explain what the design decisions were

                 used to achieve the visual fidelity of the typography
                 across devices will be explained as they impact the
                 design decisions that had to be made. The design
                 decisions involve issues about the type model used,

                 device dependency. The WYSIWYG system was successful on

                 pattern-matching approach is used. Essentially, a set

                 which they are combined to exploit the topological
                 structure of characters. By virtue of the new pattern

                 chemical structure diagrams. It attempts to capture the
                 way that a chemist would describe a structural formula
                 to a colleague over the telephone. CHEM is implemented
                 as a PIC preprocessor, and runs under the UNIX
                 operating system. Its textural input makes CHEM
                 input-device independent and does not require a
                 graphics terminal. CHEM diagrams can be integrated with
                 text, and can also be used to produce slides and
                 viewgraphs. CHEM is best suited for organic chemists,
                 natural products chemists, and polymer chemists,
                 although it can also be used for inorganic structure
                 diagrams. This manuscript describes the design of CHEM
                 and provides a tutorial on its use.",

                 to facilitate the inclusion of printed music in the
                 output of a typesetting system. The music program acts
                 as a preprocessor to troff, which is the typesetting
                 program associated with the UNIX system. The design of
                 the music input language has concentrated on the
                 simplicity of the process of transcribing and typing in
                 data from a standard music score, yet still allowing
                 some of the complex requirements of serious music
                 scores to be handled.",

                 described. The target operating environment and the
                 environment required for running the T//EX82 program
                 are compared. The transporting procedure and the
                 requirements for compiling and running the T//EX82
                 program are described, along with the problems that
                 they caused. The measures taken to adapt T//EX82 to the
                 target operating environment are explained. The working
                 principles and some implementation details of the
                 output typesetting program are described, where rather
                 esoteric techniques are employed. Finally, some
                 measurements of performance are given.",

                 recording latent image, the recording drum is rotated
                 at high speed of 4,000 r. p. m. A newly devised
                 multiple-channel head is employed in the printer. The
                 track width of the preceding channels are wider than
                 those of the succeeding channels. The latent images
                 recorded by the preceding channels are sequentially
                 overlapped by the succeeding channels. The recording
                 resolution of 454 dots per inch was achieved. In this

                 of different typefaces. Implementations of typefaces
                 are commonly referred to as fonts. Typically, sets of
                 fonts used in an EPS come from different sources, i.e.
                 vendors, and they use different encoding mappings, e.g.
                 ASCII, XCl, EBCIDIC, etc. Furthermore, a logical font
                 which the user uses or sees may be based on a different
                 number of machine (printer or typesetter) fonts. In an
                 EPS system fonts must be handled in such a way to
                 shield the user from such idiosyncrasies and also to
                 make tasks of document composition and typesetting as
                 efficient as possible. This paper treats such problems

                 availability of machine-readable files of books

                 provide end users electronic access to the full text of

                 library, this paper identifies design considerations
                 for systems that offer access to full-text nonfiction

                 be the most popular method for selecting a given book

                 interests in fields as diverse as philosophy, political
                 economy, and mechanical computing. While attempting to
                 realize a machine for calculating and printing

                 learn metalworking techniques, invented a system of

                 machine, and devised a method for correct typesetting.

                 music information growing, and the transition from
                 traditional music printing methods to computer
                 typesetting that is being faced by music publishers,
                 there is an increasing need for an efficient and
                 accurate method of getting musical information into
                 computers. This paper describes some of the technical
                 problems encountered in developing a system, based upon
                 the IBM PC and a low-cost scanning device, to
                 automatically recognise the printed music notation on a
                 sheet of music that is fed through the scanner.",

                 A coarse scaling is determined by the Laplacian

                 size is within a factor of two. Complete size

                 directions and direction changes. These features are

                 the 300 dpi resolution on laser printers is not good
                 enough for professional publication. This shortcoming
                 can be overcome by printing the files generated by
                 desktop publishing software on high-end
                 phototypesetting equipment, such as the Linotronic 100,
                 which has a resolution of 1250 dpi. However, this can
                 be an expensive process. By focusing on Xerox Ventura
                 Desktop Publisher, this article explains how one can
                 use a desktop publishing system to attain high-end

                 design algorithms for page splitting and page layout.
                 From the rules or heuristics used for page splitting,
                 an algorithm was devised that closely matched human

                 secrets that allow computer users to turn their
                 printers into high-performance typesetting machines.
                 PostScript is device-independent, which means it will
                 work on any host computer, including all PC clones.
                 LaserWriter works beautifully with any of these
                 machines. PostScript even includes a free secret and
                 automatic two-host network that does not require
                 AppleTalk or any fancy cables. Getting PostScript
                 communications up and running the first time can be
                 extremely frustrating. Many communications programs
                 will not change their parameters in real-time. Tricks
                 discussed in this article include pseudocompiling and
                 proc caching. Learning PostScript thoroughly will open
                 your eyes to some amazing possbilities, including
                 book-on-demand publishing with just a simple 300-dpi
                 PostScript printer. By tuning your PostScript
                 techniques, you can turn this machine into a
                 high-performance machine without further investment in

  abstract =     "A new system for the recognition of a multifont
                 photoscript Arabic text is introduced. The
                 distinguishing feature of such text is that it is
                 written cursively. This imposes an additional
                 requirement of isolating each character or set of
                 overlapping characters before recognition. The proposed
                 system is composed of three interleaved phases. The
                 segmentation phase attempts to produce an initial set
                 of characters from the connected text according to a
                 set of predefined rules. The output is then passed to a
                 preliminary classification phase that attempts to label
                 the unknown characters into one of ten possible classes
                 according to a set of rules that acquire their
                 parameter values through learning. The last phase
                 contains a more elaborate set of rules that recognize
                 characters within each class. This recognition phase is
                 designed to allow errors during segmentation and\slash
                 or classification to be rectified through an adaptive
                 recognition technique. The system has been implemented
                 and tested on several fonts with a recognition rate of
                 130 words\slash min and an error rate of less than

                 with six font representations. These two models are
                 very similar, but Model H-H2 has the capability for
                 modification of the basins of attraction during the
                 training phase, whereas Model H-H1 does not. This
                 appears to be a desirable feature for a neural network.
                 It is shown in this work that this is indeed true. In
                 either model, it is difficult to find a single set of
                 parameters for one network or memory that can
                 distinguish all of the characters. Therefore, a cascade
                 of memories is utilized. Thus, in the training phase, a
                 decision tree is built by cascading the memory matrices
                 that represent the models. That is successive layers of
                 refinement in selection of basins of attraction are
                 used to generate output patterns unique to each input
                 pattern. In the recognition phase, the subject
                 characters are recognized by searching in the tree.
                 Model parameters such as memory array size, S${}_{min}$
                 S${}_{max}$, and M${}_{min}$ M${}_{max}$ were varied to
                 elucidate the models' behavior. It is shown that there
                 exist parameter values for both models to achieve a
                 100\% recognition rate when all six fonts are used both
                 as the training and the recognition set. Model H-H2
                 significantly outperformed Model H-H1 in terms of
                 recognition rate, use of memory space, and learning
                 speed when all six fonts were used as the training
                 set.",

                 Engineering of Visual Display Workstations specifies
                 that character height-to-width ratios be within the
                 range of 1:0.7 to 1:0.9. The empirical literature,
                 however, fails to provide unequivocal support for that
                 requirement. In designing CRT displays there is a
                 complex interaction among several parameters, including
                 character aspect ratio and character height. The
                 present study compared a font with a character aspect
                 ratio within the range allowed by ANSI\slash HFS
                 100-1988 to a font with a character aspect ratio
                 outside that range. Using three different
                 visually-intensive tasks, no real performance
                 differences between the two fonts were observed. The
                 study demonstrated that meeting individual design
                 specifications, such as those provided in ANSI\slash
                 HFS 100-1988, does not necessarily produce the most
                 legible character set. It is argued that a

                 However, use of double-pixel-width characters can
                 substantially reduce reading errors when
                 noncatastrophic dot-matrix display failures occur.
                 Using a single-pixel-width font as a reference, an
                 enhanced, 7 \$MUL@ 9 matrix size, two-pixel-width

                 (failure of a single row or column to make one
                 character look as much like another as possible) was
                 applied to both font versions. Twenty-two subjects

                 errors when simulated row\slash column failures occur.

                 designed to enable new users of desktop publishing
                 technologies to produce typeset documents which
                 approach or match commercial quality standards.
                 ``Typesetting--A Tutorial for the Desktop Publisher''
                 is a computer assisted instructional (CAI) program that
                 provides students with an understanding of the
                 traditional language of type while developing
                 familiarity with the rules of page layout and design.
                 The design and development of the programmed tutorial
                 is grounded on three assumptions: (1) the main focus of
                 the CAI course must be on enabling operators with
                 non-specialized skills to learn the fundamentals of
                 typesetting; (2) new desktop publishing personnel
                 productivity can be dramatically increased, and
                 learning curves reduced, by a computerized course in
                 which learners control their own pace while learning
                 the elements, principles, and language of typesetting;
                 and (3) operators must know when, how, and why to
                 utilize the tools that are available to them, thus the
                 concepts surrounding document production must be
                 familiar to them. Results of administration of the CAI
                 course indicated a high level of student interest in
                 CAI as a medium of instruction. The flexibility of the
                 user interface provided an impetus for student
                 exploration. Excitement with the tools for learning and
                 the stimulation to interact and play with the media
                 were key factors in the general success of the learning
                 event. The ability of individual students to guide
                 themselves and manipulate their private learning
                 environments were challenges to which participants
                 responded strongly. (14 references) (DB)",

                 inexpensive line scanners that perform with arc-second
                 and sub-arc-second accuracies. Such accuracies fall
                 into the realm of the requirements of high-performance
                 scanners. The sub-arc-second accuracy of the rotational
                 axis of scanners is generally accomplished by using
                 custom-designed gas bearings instead of the
                 less-expensive ball bearings. Subject to design, ball
                 bearings are typically rated to achieve accuracies
                 ranging from 20 to 5 arc sec. The less-expensive and
                 replaceable commercially available ball bearings can
                 effectively satisfy this industry's requirement if a
                 passive optical-feedback design feature is included in
                 a scanner's beam-deflecting head. This feedback, which
                 is embodied in a given scanner desensitizes the
                 scanning beam to the scan-line tracking errors that are
                 caused by wobble of the rotational axis. The butterfly
                 line scanner is a two-piece, four-facet scanning
                 device. Its symmetry simplifies both its design and
                 construction and also its alignment and dynamic
                 balancing; moreover, it leads to a compact unit.",

  abstract =     "{\TeX} is a typesetting system that is used for
                 publishing scholarly material, especially works
                 containing heavy mathematics. It is popular at
                 universities and research facilities around the world,
                 but it is hardly known outside academic circles. Since
                 {\TeX} is available on desktop platforms (as well as on
                 mainframes and minicomputers), it is competitive to
                 some extent with desktop publishing software. There are
                 still many applications where {\TeX} produces results
                 that are better than those of standard desktop
                 packages. There are a few things {\TeX} can do that
                 couldn't be practically done with desktop software.
                 There is a new {\TeX} implementation, {\TeX}tures,
                 which moves {\TeX} a little closer to the desktop
                 mainstream. It holds out the hope that {\TeX} may yet
                 have the potential to become as easy to use as other
                 desktop packages. The author discusses the innovations
                 built in to {\TeX}, its strengths and weaknesses, and
                 its uses. (0 Refs.)",

                 labeling of various consumer products, and over the
                 counter and prescription drugs. The purpose of the
                 present research was to examine certain variables that
                 are associated with legibility, namely font type, font
                 weight, point size, and point size contrast between the
                 signal word and the main body of the warning. A sample
                 of undergraduate students and elderly people rated 24
                 Ultra Tide detergent labels for their likelihood to
                 read the warning, the saliency of the warning, and
                 readability of the warning. The results indicated that
                 participants were more likely to read the warning in
                 Helvetica type than in Times or Goudy. Times was more
                 likely to be read than Goudy. Bold type was more likely
                 to be read than Roman type. There was a greater
                 likelihood of reading the warning when the main body
                 was in 10 point size as compared to 8 point size. A 2
                 point size difference between the signal word and the
                 main body of the warning produced a greater likelihood
                 of reading the warning over a 4 point size difference.
                 One possibility for this result is that the 4 point
                 difference minimizes the importance of the main body of
                 the warning, therefore making only the signal word

                 solved by intelligent systems. One such problem might
                 be `paint a portrait of George Bush in the style of
                 Vincent van Gogh.' In these tasks, a low dimensional
                 representation ('George Bush' and `style of van Gogh')
                 is expanded into a (nonunique) output of extremely high
                 dimension, for instance represented by color, line,
                 shading, etc. We designed a connectionist network for
                 generalization of production in such a way --- to
                 generate letterforms in a new font given just a few
                 exemplars from that font. During learning, our network
                 constructs distributed internal representations of
                 different fonts and letters, even though each training
                 instance had both font characteristics and letter
                 characteristics. Separate hidden representations for
                 `letter' and `font' were necessary for success of the
                 network. The integration of information from font and
                 letter representations had to be at a proper,
                 intermediate level of abstraction. The limitations of
                 the network can be attributed, in part, to limited
                 training corpus, and lack of translation and scale

                 applied to help extract the strokes. The method cannot

                 heuristically eliminate noises including those added to
                 strokes for artistic sake. Moreover, this method does

                 potential keywords are extracted from the image using a
                 morphology-based preprocessor. Feature vectors based on
                 the external shape and internal structure of the word
                 are computed over vertical columns of pixels in a word
                 bounding box. For each user-specified keyword, an HMM
                 is created by concatenating appropriate
                 context-dependent character HMMs. Non-keywords are
                 modeled using an HMM based on context-dependent
                 sub-character models. Keyword spotting is performed
                 using a Viterbi search through the HMM network created
                 by connecting the keyword and non-keyword HMMs in
                 parallel. Applications of word-image spotting include

                 computer typesetting program {\TeX}. In this study, the
                 strategies are considered effective at revealing a
                 defect only when any test set that satisfies the
                 strategy is capable of revealing the defect. It is

                 flow strategies are effective at revealing a reasonable
                 number of the defects. For those defects for which the
                 control and data flow strategies were not effective,
                 other well-known methods such as special value testing,
                 boundary testing, or static data flow analysis were
                 usually effective. The results suggest that systematic
                 testing strategies for which tool support is possible
                 can eliminate a significant number of defects

  abstract =     "Consider the problem of generating bitmaps from
                 character shapes given as outlines. The obvious
                 scan-conversion process does not produce acceptable
                 results unless important features such as stem widths
                 are carefully controlled during the scan-conversion
                 process. This paper describes a method for
                 automatically extracting the necessary feature
                 information and generating high-quality bitmaps without
                 resorting to hand editing. Almost all of the work is
                 done in a preprocessing step, the result of which is an
                 intermediate form that can be quickly converted into
                 bitmaps once the font size and device resolution are
                 known. A heuristically defined system of linear
                 equations describes how the ideal outlines should be
                 distorted in order to produce the best possible results
                 when scan converted in a straightforward manner. The
                 Lovasz basis reduction algorithm then reduces the
                 system of equations to a form that makes it easy to
                 find an approximate solution subject to the constraint
                 that some variables must be integers. The heuristic
                 information is of such a general nature that it applies
                 equally well to Roman fonts and Japanese Kanji.",

                 defined in terms of a set of parameters (font metrics)
                 that specify the relative locations of the local
                 coordinate systems of adjacent characters in a line of
                 text. The primary font metrics for horizontal letter
                 spacing are the character set widths and sidebearings
                 and the character pair spacing adjustments (kerning
                 terms). A typical parameter for vertical alignment is
                 the character depth below baseline. This paper
                 discusses the problem of determining font metrics from
                 measurements on images of typeset text and develops
                 least-squares procedures for font metric estimation.
                 When it is known that kerning is not present,
                 sidebearing estimation involves solving a set of linear
                 equations, called the sidebearing normal equations,
                 More generally, simultaneous sidebearing and kerning
                 term estimation involves an iterative procedure in
                 which a modified set of sidebearing normal equations is
                 solved during each iteration. Character depth estimates
                 are obtained by solving a set of baseline normal
                 equations. In a preliminary evaluation of the proposed
                 procedures on scanned text images in three fonts the
                 root-mean-square set width estimation error was about
                 0.2 pixel. A novel application of font metric
                 estimation to text image editing is discussed.",

                 sheet transformation and its use as a tool in an
                 interactive font design environment. The designer works
                 with graph-paper-like orthogonal grids and applies the
                 rubber sheet transformation to the gridspace to obtain
                 new shapes. Further, he or she may subsequently work on
                 the transformed gridspace to fine-tune the shapes. A
                 computationally efficient deformation mapping technique
                 for use in such an interactive design environment has
                 been presented. An important feature is that the order
                 of the high-level outline definitions of the deformed
                 shape is the same as that of the original design.The
                 shape deformation takes place in three stages. In the
                 first stage, the original 2D shape is mapped onto a
                 user definable doubly-curved surface. Next the surface
                 is affinely transformed, once again under the control
                 of the user. In the last stage the transformed 3D shape
                 is projected onto a plane to get the deformed shape. We
                 discuss this deformation technique, and a refinement of
                 this technique, where the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are
                 handled independently. This technique has been
                 incorporated in a font design system. Vinyas, to

                 the design of calligraphic style typefaces. It has been
                 designed primarily for creating new fonts rather than
                 enabling the transfer of existing fonts from paper to
                 machine. Within this environment a comprehensive set of
                 interactive tools are available to the type font
                 designer for typeface design. Vinyas is based on a
                 powerful font design methodology, viz, the pen stroke
                 method of specifying shapes. With minimal interaction,
                 the designer can describe his forms, edit them,
                 visualize them singly or in combination, and then
                 create a full dictionary of letterforms for use. Unlike
                 many other systems based on this methodology which
                 produce the final output as bitmaps, Vinyas generates
                 scalable analytic descriptions that are downloadable to
                 a Postscript${}^{TM}$ laser printer or typesetter. This
                 paper describes the design of the Vinyas system and
                 certain novel aspects of its user interface. The paper
                 also describes the design process and the feature

                 weight, point size, and point size contrast between the
                 signal word and the main body of the warning (signal
                 word-text size difference). A sample of 40

                 which varied across all levels of the type form

                 recognizing Arabic characters. Arabic OCR faces
                 technical problems not encountered in other languages
                 such as cursiveness, overriding and overlapping of
                 characters, multiple shapes per character and the
                 presence of vowels above and below the characters. The
                 proposed approach relies on the fact that the process
                 of connecting Arabic characters to produce cursive
                 writing tends to form a fictitious baseline. During
                 preprocessing, contour analysis provides both component
                 isolation and baseline location. In the feature
                 extraction phase, the words are processed from right to
                 left to generate a sequence of labels. Each label is
                 one of a predetermined codebook that represents all
                 possible bit distribution with respect to the baseline.
                 At a certain position, which depends on the label
                 context, a segmentation decision is taken. During
                 training, a model is generated for each character. This
                 model describes the probability of the occurrence of
                 the labels at each vertical position. During
                 recognition, the probability of the label observation
                 sequence is computed and accumulated. The system has
                 been tested on different typewritten, typeset fonts and
                 diacriticized versions of both and the evaluation
                 results are presented.",

                 of local typeface homogeneity to improve the accuracy
                 of a character classifier. Given a polyfont classifier
                 which is capable of recognizing any of 100 typefaces
                 moderately well, our method allows it to specialize
                 itself automatically to the single --- but otherwise
                 unknown --- typeface it is reading. Essentially, the
                 classifier retrains itself after examining some of the
                 images, guided at first by the preset classification
                 boundaries of the given classifier, and later by the
                 behavior of the retrained classifier. Experimental
                 trials on 6.4 M pseudo-randomly distorted images show
                 that the method improves on 95 of the 100 typefaces. It
                 reduces the error rate by a factor of 2.5, averaged
                 over 100 typefaces, when applied to an alphabet of 80
                 ASCII characters printed at ten point and digitized at
                 300 pixels\slash inch. This self-correcting method
                 complements, and does not hinder, other methods for

                 The article focuses on the development of typesetting
                 in jobbing printing in Iceland and Sweden. Particular

                 digital images of machine-printed text into their ASCII
                 equivalent is information about fonts. This paper
                 presents an algorithm for identifying the font in which
                 a document is printed. The algorithm matches word-level
                 information gathered from the document image to fonts
                 in an image database. This method is more robust in the
                 presence of noise than font recognition algorithms that
                 use character-level information. Clusters of frequent
                 function words (such as the, of, and, a, and to) are
                 constructed from an input document image. The clusters
                 are then matched to a database of function words
                 derived from document images, and the document that
                 matches best provides the identification of the input
                 font. This technique utilizes the context from many
                 words in an input document to overcome noise.
                 Experimental results are presented that show
                 near-perfect recognition of fonts, even in noisy

  abstract =     "The idea of box connectivity approach (BCA) is to
                 partition the bounding frame of the character bitmap
                 into a fixed number of rectangles, to define some
                 properties of those rectangles, and to establish
                 connectivity relations between the rectangles. Hamming
                 distance and vector optimization are used for
                 classification. Good results in recognition of high
                 quality data (400 dpi) in three fonts (Courier,
                 Helvetica, and New Times Roman) and eight sizes (from 8
                 to 24 points) were reported in a previous paper. These
                 findings are confirmed in this paper by an experiment
                 showing that, for the same number of bits, BCA features
                 increase the rate of recognition twice with respect to
                 features obtained by simple decimation. However, the
                 actual method is limited by the fact that the number of
                 referent templates increases with the number of fonts
                 to be recognized. The purpose of this paper is to
                 remove this limitation. The main part of the paper
                 discusses the properties of the Hamming distance and
                 how they can be used in the BCA algorithm to improve
                 the efficiency of classification. The last section

                 of needs. This book, written by the original architect
                 and implementer of \LaTeX{} is both the user's guide
                 and the reference manual for the software. It has been
                 updated to reflect the changes in the new release. The
                 book begins with instructions for formatting simpler
                 text, and progressively describes commands and
                 techniques for handling larger and more complicated
                 documents. A separate chapter explains how to deal with
                 errors. An added appendix describes what is new and
                 different in \LaTeX{} $ 2_\epsilon $. Other additions
                 to the second edition include descriptions of new
                 commands for inserting pictures prepared with other
                 programs and for producing colored output; new sections
                 on how to make books and slides; instructions for
                 making an index with the MakeIndex program, and an
                 updated guide to preparing a bibliography with the
                 BibTeX program; plus a section on how to send your
                 \LaTeX{} documents electronically. Users new to
                 \LaTeX{} will find here a book that has earned
                 worldwide praise as a model for clear, concise, and
                 practical documentation. Experienced users will want to
                 update their \LaTeX{} library. Although most standard
                 \LaTeX{} input files will work with \LaTeX{} $
                 2_\epsilon $, to take advantage of the new features, a
                 few \LaTeX{} $ 2_\epsilon $ conventions must first be
                 learned. For users who want an advanced guide to
                 \LaTeX{} $ 2_\epsilon $ and to more than 150 packages
                 that can now be used at any site to provide additional
                 features, a useful companion to this book is
                 \booktitle{The \LaTeX{} Companion}, by Goossens,

  abstract =     "This paper reports the performance of several neural
                 network models on the problem of multi-font character
                 recognition. The networks are trained on machine
                 generated, upper-case English letters in selected
                 fonts. The task is to recognize the same letters in
                 different fonts. The results presented here were
                 produced by back-propagation networks, radial basis
                 networks and a new hybrid algorithm which is a
                 combination of the two. These results are compared to
                 those of the Hogg-Hubermann model as well as to those
                 of nearest neighbor and maximum likelihood classifiers.
                 The effects of varying the number of nodes in the
                 hidden layer, the initial conditions, and the number of
                 iterations in a back-propagation network were studied.
                 The experimental results indicate that the number of
                 nodes is an important factor in the recognition rate
                 and that over-training is a significant problem.
                 Different initial conditions also had a measurable
                 effect on performance. The radial basis experiments
                 used different numbers of centers and differing
                 techniques for selecting the means and standard
                 deviations. The best results were obtained with one
                 center per training vector in which the standard
                 deviation for each center was set to the same small
                 number. Finally, a new hybrid technique is discussed in
                 which a radial basis network is used to determine a
                 starting point for a back-propagation network. The
                 back-propagation network refines the radial basis means
                 and standard deviations which are replaced in the
                 radial basis network and used for another iteration.
                 All three networks out-performed the Hogg-Hubermann
                 network as well as the maximum likelihood
                 classifiers.",

  abstract =     "The huge amount of storage needed for document images
                 is a major hindrance to widespread use of document
                 image processing (DIP) systems. Although current DIP
                 systems store document images in a compressed form,
                 there is much room for improvement. In this paper, a
                 nearly-lossless document image compression method is
                 investigated which preserves the relevant information
                 of a document. The proposed approach is based on the
                 segmentation of a document image into different blocks
                 that are classified into one of several block classes
                 and compressed by a block-class-specific data
                 compression method. Whereas image and graphics blocks
                 are compressed using standard image compression
                 methods, text blocks are fed into a text and font
                 recognition module and converted into their textual
                 representation. Finally, text blocks are compressed by
                 encoding their textual representation and enough
                 formatting information to be able to render them as
                 faithfully as possible to the original document.
                 Preliminary results show that (1) the achievable
                 compression ratios compare favorably with standard
                 document image compression methods for all document
                 images tested and (2) the quality of the decompressed
                 image depends on the recognition accuracy of the text
                 recognition module.",

                 process whereby printed documents are transformed into
                 ASCII files for the purpose of compact storage,
                 editing, fast retrieval, and other file manipulations
                 through the use of a computer. The recognition stage of
                 an OCR process is made difficult by added noise, image
                 distortion, and the various character typefaces, sizes,
                 and fonts that a document may have. In this study a
                 neural network approach is introduced to perform high
                 accuracy recognition on multi-size and multi-font
                 characters; a novel centroid-dithering training process
                 with a low noise-sensitivity normalization procedure is
                 used to achieve high accuracy results. The study
                 consists of two parts. The first part focuses on single
                 size and single font characters, and a two-layered
                 neural network is trained to recognize the full set of
                 94 ASCII character images in 12-pt Courier font. The
                 second part trades accuracy for additional font and
                 size capability, and a larger two-layered neural
                 network is trained to recognize the full set of 94
                 ASCII character images for all point sizes from 8 to 32
                 and for 12 commonly used fonts. The performance of
                 these two networks is evaluated based on a database of

                 data set.",

                 and the distinct features of a font, which
                 traditionally were realized by a proficient artisan's
                 hand and eye. Modern approaches endeavor to gain the

                 specifications in the design process. The goal of which
                 is to ensure that the displayed version is both legible
                 and aesthetically acceptable. This paper provides an
                 insight about the design methods used to both model and
                 represent the contours of Latin characters and fonts.

  abstract =     "Oriental characters (such as Chinese, Korean, and
                 Japanese characters) are composed of several strokes,
                 and the shape of each stroke is determined by a brush
                 sweep. In the paper, a new representation scheme is
                 proposed for the design of stroke-structured fonts.
                 This approach (called a structured composition of
                 stroke elements) reflects the characteristics of
                 oriental characters; each character is constructed as a
                 set of strokes, and each stroke is represented by
                 primitive features called stroke elements. Since the
                 construction of an exact brush sweep is computationally
                 quite expensive, we suggest a simple approximation
                 method. The outlines of stroke pens are used to
                 represent the starting, ending, and bending of a
                 stroke. The positions of seed pens are interpolated to
                 generate the skeleton curve of a stroke trajectory. The
                 outline of each stroke is generated automatically from
                 the stroke elements. The boundary of each character is
                 constructed by merging these stroke outlines. This
                 approach has various advantages: the font design
                 becomes much simpler, the necessary storage space is
                 greatly reduced, and the font variation becomes much
                 more flexible.",

                 component in the performance analysis of pattern
                 matching systems. In the past three years, the results
                 of numerous excellent and rigorous studies of OCR
                 system typeset-character accuracy (henceforth OCR
                 accuracy) have been published, encouraging performance
                 comparisons between a variety of OCR products and
                 technologies. These published figures are important;
                 OCR vendor advertisements in the popular trade
                 magazines lead readers to believe that published OCR
                 accuracy figures effect market share in the lucrative
                 OCR market. Curiously, a detailed review of many of
                 these OCR error occurrence counting results reveals
                 that they are not reproducible as published and they
                 are not strictly comparable due to larger variances in
                 the counts than would be expected by the sampling
                 variance. Naturally, since OCR accuracy is based on a
                 ratio of the number of OCR errors over the size of the
                 text searched for errors, imprecise OCR error
                 accounting leads to similar imprecision in OCR
                 accuracy. Some published papers use informal,
                 non-automatic, or intuitively correct OCR error
                 accounting. Still other published results present OCR
                 error accounting methods based on string matching
                 algorithms such as dynamic programming using
                 Levenshtein (edit) distance but omit critical
                 implementation details (such as the existence of
                 suspect markers in the OCR generated output or the
                 weights used in the dynamic programming minimization
                 procedure). The problem with not specifically revealing
                 the accounting method is that the number of errors
                 found by different methods are significantly different.
                 This paper identifies the basic accounting methods used
                 to measure OCR errors in typeset text and offers an
                 evaluation and comparison of the various accounting

                 for assessing the impact of cluster defects on
                 dot-matrix display font readability. Cluster defects
                 consist of groups of two or more adjacent inoperative
                 display picture elements. Determining the sizes and
                 quantities of cluster defects that can be safely
                 tolerated is a substantial task considering the large
                 number of ways these defects can occur. The magnitude
                 of this task is substantially reduced through the
                 application of an update to a software product called
                 FontTool. The first version of FontTool, an MS DOS
                 based tool, addressed row and column dot-matrix display
                 defects. The updated version described herein provides
                 many of the extensions necessary to access the impact
                 of cluster defects. Savings in display production and
                 life cycle maintenance costs may be realized by
                 applying this tool to design font characters that are
                 more readable in the presence of cluster defects.",

                 character can be represented by a structured character
                 description. The scheme for designing a character is
                 presented in details. Our discussion includes stroke
                 definition, building up components, and balancing the
                 appearance of a character. A number of factors are
                 considered in designing and harmonizing a character
                 which includes component spacing, complexity,
                 blackness, visual centre, centre of gravity, and
                 attractive force. A prototype font design system is
                 being built according to this component-based approach.
                 Samples are given to show how a Chinese character can

                 be potentially very useful in many computational
                 applications, but is not available in electronic form.
                 This knowledge comes in the form of mechanically
                 typeset books and journals going back more than 100
                 years. Besides these older sources, there are a great
                 many current publications, filled with useful
                 mathematical information, which are difficult if not
                 impossible to obtain in electronic form. Our work
                 intends to encode, for use by computer algebra systems,
                 integral tables and other documents currently available
                 in hardcopy only. Our strategy is to extract character
                 information from these documents, which is then passed
                 to higher-level parsing routines for further extraction
                 of mathematical content (or any other useful
                 two-dimensional semantic content). This information can
                 then be output as, for example, a Lisp or \TeX{}
                 expression. We have also developed routines for rapid
                 access to this information, specifically for finding
                 matches with formulas in a table of integrals. This

  abstract =     "Printed mathematics has a number of features which
                 distinguish it from conventional text. These include
                 structure in two dimensions (fractions, exponents,
                 limits), frequent font changes, symbols with variable
                 shape (quotient bars), and substantially differing
                 notational conventions from source to source. When
                 compounded with more generic problems such as noise and
                 merged or broken characters, printed mathematics offers
                 a challenging arena for recognition. Our project was
                 initially driven by the goal of scanning and parsing
                 some 5,000 pages of elaborate mathematics (tables of
                 definite integrals). While our prototype system
                 demonstrates success on translating noise-free typeset
                 equations into Lisp expressions appropriate for further
                 processing, a more semantic top-down approach appears
                 necessary for higher levels of performance. Such an
                 approach may benefit the incorporation of these
                 programs into a more general document processing
                 viewpoint. We intend to release to the public our
                 somewhat refined prototypes as utility programs in the
                 hope that they will be of general use in the
                 construction of custom OCR packages. These utilities
                 are quite fast even as originally prototyped in Lisp,
                 where they may be of particular interest to those
                 working on `intelligent' optical processing. Some
                 routines have been re-written in C++ as well.
                 Additional programs providing formula recognition and
                 parsing also form a part of this system. It is
                 important however to realize that distinct conflicting
                 grammars are needed to cover variations in contemporary
                 and historical typesetting, and thus a single simple
                 solution is not possible.",

  abstract =     "The expression `newspaper of record' is most often
                 found among works by lawyers, historians, and
                 librarians. Yet many newspapers are now developing
                 online news products that do not correspond directly to
                 the newsprint version. Many are asking whether online
                 newspapers will replace traditional newsprint products
                 and whether the online version can or should be treated
                 as equal to the newsprint version. Martin and Hansen
                 focus on some of the traditional uses of newspapers by
                 groups who use the `newspaper of record' concept, and
                 they compare traditional newspapers to online
                 newspapers as `records.' After a historical review,
                 they examine legal and archival uses for newspapers,
                 report on several case studies of online newspaper
                 production, and conclude with suggestions for future
                 scholarly, legal, and industry focus on the `newspaper
                 of record' concept. This valuable analysis serves
                 professionals in journalism and law as well as scholars
                 and researchers in journalism and archive management.",

                 needs to quickly learn how to write and typeset
                 articles and books containing mathematical formulas,
                 and requires a thorough reference book on all aspects
                 of LaTeX and the AMS packages (the enhancements to
                 LaTeX by the American Mathematical Society). Key
                 features of \booktitle{Math Into LaTeX}: * A simple,
                 example-based, visual approach * A quick introduction
                 (Part I) allowing readers to type their first articles
                 in only a few hours * Sample articles to demonstrate
                 the basic structure of LaTeX and AMS articles * Useful
                 appendices containing mathematical and text symbol
                 tables and information on how to convert from older
                 versions * A new chapter in the fourth edition,
                 ``\booktitle{A Visual Introduction to MikTeX},'' an
                 open source implementation of TeX and LaTeX for Windows
                 operating systems * Another new chapter describing
                 amsrefs, a simpler method for formatting references
                 that incorporates and replaces BibTeX data * This
                 edition also integrates a major revision to the amsart
                 document class, along with updated examples.",

                 text and a page to print to, where are the best places
                 to start new lines within the paragraphs for the most
                 visually appealing layout? The most well-known and used
                 optimising typesetting software is \TeX{}, which solves
                 the line breaking problem according to an internal
                 function of a paragraph's ``badness.''\par

                 We propose an alternative formulation of the problem in
                 which the quality of a candidate paragraph is measured
                 along several objective functions which are easily
                 defined by real-world solution-space metrics. Rather
                 than presenting a single solution to the user, our
                 algorithm finds the Pareto-optimal set of paragraphs
                 given a set of objective functions.\par

                 To support our algorithm, we devise a new method for
                 determining feasible hyphenation points within a
                 paragraph in a single pass, which is general enough to
                 apply to and improve the original \TeX{}
                 algorithm.\par

                 Our results show that global multiple objective
                 paragraph optimisation gives solutions consistently
                 better than \TeX{} along our real-world metrics, and
                 that a range of solutions are returned representing a
                 genuine trade-off in typographic quality.",

                 Bodoni set the standard for printing the alphabet with

                 printer for the Duke of Parma, Bodoni (1740--1813)
                 declared that well-designed type derived its beauty
                 from four principles: uniformity of design, sharpness
                 and neatness, good taste, and charm. His typefaces

                 culmination of more than four decades of work, the

                 classic trilogy on the English language combines the
                 first history of English punctuation with a complete
                 guide on how to use it. Behind every punctuation mark
                 lies a thousand stories. The punctuation of English,
                 marked with occasional rationality, is founded on
                 arbitrariness and littered with oddities. For a system
                 of a few dozen marks it generates a disproportionate
                 degree of uncertainty and passion, inspiring
                 organizations like the Apostrophe Protection Society
                 and sending enthusiasts, correction-pens in hand, in a
                 crusade against error across the United States.
                 Professor Crystal leads us through this minefield with
                 characteristic wit, clarity, and commonsense. In David
                 Crystal's Making a Point, he gives a fascinating

                 punctuation mark over one and a half millennia and

                 what do they really mean, and how did we come to write
                 them down in the first place? Michael Rosen takes you
                 on an unforgettable adventure through the history of
                 the alphabet in twenty-six vivid chapters, fizzing with
                 personal anecdotes and fascinating facts. Starting with
                 the mysterious Phoenicians and how sounds first came to
                 be written down, he races on to show how nonsense poems
                 work, pins down the strange story of OK, traces our
                 five lost letters and tackles the tyranny of spelling,
                 among many other things. His heroes of the alphabet
                 range from Edward Lear to Phyllis Pearsall (the
                 inventor of the A--Z), and from the two scribes of
                 Beowulf to rappers. Each chapter takes on a different
                 subject --- whether it's codes, umlauts or the writing
                 of dictionaries. Rosen's enthusiasm for letters
                 positively leaps off the page, whether it's the story
                 of his life told through the typewriters he's owned or
                 a chapter on jokes written in a string of gags and word
                 games. This is the book for anyone who's ever wondered
                 why Hawaiian only has a thirteen-letter alphabet or how

                 floor of Gutenberg's print shop or the hot molten lead
                 of the linotype machine. During the period of the
                 pivotal growth and widespread adoption of word
                 processing as a writing technology, some authors
                 embraced it as a marvel while others decried it as the
                 death of literature. The product of years of archival
                 research and numerous interviews conducted by the
                 author, Track Changes is the first literary history of
                 word processing. Matthew Kirschenbaum examines how the
                 interests and ideals of creative authorship came to
                 coexist with the computer revolution. Who were the
                 first adopters? What kind of anxieties did they share?
                 Was word processing perceived as just a better
                 typewriter or something more? How did it change our
                 understanding of writing? Track Changes balances the
                 stories of individual writers with a consideration of
                 how the seemingly ineffable act of writing is always
                 grounded in particular instruments and media, from
                 quills to keyboards. Along the way, we discover the
                 candidates for the first novel written on a word
                 processor, explore the surprisingly varied reasons why
                 writers of both popular and serious literature adopted
                 the technology, trace the spread of new metaphors and
                 ideas from word processing in fiction and poetry, and
                 consider the fate of literary scholarship and memory in
                 an era when the final remnants of authorship may
                 consist of folders on a hard drive or documents in the

                 challenges common assumptions about technology's
                 influence, affirming that paper is here to stay. Paper
                 is one of the simplest and most essential pieces of
                 human technology. For the past two millennia, the
                 ability to produce it in ever more efficient ways has
                 supported the proliferation of literacy, media,
                 religion, education, commerce, and art; it has formed
                 the foundation of civilizations, promoting revolutions
                 and restoring stability. One has only to look at
                 history's greatest press run, which produced 6.5
                 billion copies of Quotations from Chairman Mao (which
                 doesn't include editions in 37 foreign languages and in
                 braille) to appreciate the range and influence of a
                 single publication, in paper. Or take the fact that one
                 of history's most revered artists, Leonardo da Vinci,
                 left behind only 15 paintings but 4,000 works on paper.
                 And though the colonies were at the time calling for a
                 boycott of all British goods, the one exception they
                 made speaks to the essentiality of the material; they
                 penned the Declaration of Independence on British
                 paper. Now, amid discussion of ``going paperless'' ---
                 And as speculation about the effects of a digitally
                 dependent society grows rampant --- we've come to a
                 world-historic juncture. Thousands of years ago,
                 Socrates and Plato warned that written language would
                 be the end of ``true knowledge,'' replacing the need to
                 exercise memory and think through complex questions.
                 Similar arguments were made about the switch from
                 handwritten to printed books, and today about the role
                 of computer technology. By tracing paper's evolution
                 from antiquity to the present, with an emphasis on the
                 contributions made in Asia and the Middle East, Mark
                 Kurlansky challenges common assumptions about
                 technology's influence, affirming that paper is here to

  remark =       "From the article, about a museum in London, UK: ``
                 There are perhaps eight million items in the Type
                 Archive she [Sue Shaw] has created, the earliest
                 probably dating back to the 16th century. Nobody really
                 knows, however, because it has not been catalogued.
                 Doing so would be a huge and difficult task. The
                 Monotype collection alone contains 5,700 drawers of
                 patterns (large metal plates engraved with the shape of
                 a letter) and 22,000 containing matrices. The former
                 are made of a thin layer of copper backed with lead.
                 Many of the drawers in which they are stored, though
                 only a few inches deep, are too heavy for one person to
                 lift. Every stage of the process is there. Alongside
                 the patterns and the matrices are thousands of boxes of
                 punches --- small metal letters which are derived from
                 the patterns and used to stamp their shape into a
                 matrix. And there are thousands of varieties of type,
                 in different fonts, sizes and alphabet: Roman,
                 Cyrillic, Sinhala and the 20 Indian languages the
                 Monotype Corporation once serviced. On the upper floor
                 are 79 of the machines used in the different stages of
                 the hot-metal process. Some are collecting dust, but
                 most --- like those used to set the title for this
                 article in Albertus, created for Monotype in the 1930s
                 by Berthold Wolpe --- are clanking away. This year, as
                 a result of Mr [Russell] Maret's curiosity, they have
                 been making the first new Monotype hot-metal font for
                 40 years.''",

                 personal and encyclopedic story of how the personal
                 computer, unique applications, and many colorful people
                 changed the creative and print communities. Author
                 Frank Romano has documented the histories of hot metal
                 and phototypesetting and continues the tale of document
                 production in this book. This installment ends as the
                 Internet becomes a primary focus. It is hard to imagine
                 someone more involved with the universe of desktop
                 publishing from its beginnings than Romano, who takes
                 us on a personal journey from the end of the typewriter
                 era to the age of the Internet, examining the
                 development of personal computers, pagemaking and
                 graphic design programs, postscript, digital fonts,
                 data storage, inkjet printing, GUIs, and the rise of
                 the digital era. For those who grew up during --- or
                 built their careers on --- these advances, this book
                 provides entertaining perspective and insight on an
                 important period of their lives. For younger readers,
                 it is a fascinating narrative of modern ancient
                 history: how we got from the typewriter to DTP. Fully
                 illustrated, with a Foreword by Gene Gable and a
