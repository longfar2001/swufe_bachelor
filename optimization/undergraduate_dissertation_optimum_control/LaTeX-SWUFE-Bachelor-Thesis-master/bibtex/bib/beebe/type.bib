                 throughout the computer graphics industry to represent
                 curved shapes. For many applications, it would be
                 useful to be able to reliably derive this
                 representation from a closely-spaced set of points that
                 approximate the desired curve, such as the input from a
                 digitizing tablet or a scanner. This paper presents a
                 solution to the problem of automatically generating
                 efficient piecewise parametric cubic polynomial
                 approximations to shapes from the sampled data. We have
                 developed an algorithm that takes a set of sample
                 points, plus optional endpoint and tangent vector
                 specifications, and iteratively dervies a single
                 parametric cubic polynomial that lies close to the data
                 points as defined by an error metric based on
                 least-squares. Combining this algorithm with dynamic
                 programming techniques to determine the knot placement
                 gives good results over a range of shapes and

                 is presented. This adaptive algorithm generates a curve
                 with first-order geometric continuity ($G^1$), within
                 an error bound specified by the user, and generates an
                 interpolating curve in the case of exact fit. The use
                 of this algorithm in an interactive curve design system
                 is discussed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
                 of the method are presented, using examples generated
                 by the current implementation of the design system.",
