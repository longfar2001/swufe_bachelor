                 independent. Primary design objectives were
                 transportability, maintainability, and ease of use.
                 Features supported by TIGS include line, arc,
                 multi-line plot, test and dot primitives with
                 resettable attributes such as line style, character
                 size, intensity, font, color, transformation matrix,

                 represent a wide range of physical devices. TIGS

                 a device independent neutral display file. This neutral
                 display file contains information describing all
                 segments, pictures, windows, and viewports in a device

                 printer by the method of moving the print mechanism or
                 character font. A character printer moves the printhead
                 across the paper a single column at a time. The line
                 printer moves the entire character set past the impact
                 hammers in a vertical (drum) or horizontal (band-train)
                 format. The print mechanism contains one hammer per
                 column of print position. The printable character set
                 is scanned past the hammers at a constant velocity.
                 When a character reaches the column to be printed with
                 that character, the printer control causes the hammer
                 to impact the character at that column. This can only
                 be achieved by the character set speed being controlled

                 Molecular Structures and Dimensions. Each volume
                 contains a bibliographic listing ordered in 86 chemical
                 classes and includes cross-references. A set of five
                 indexes, based on compound names, molecular formulas,
                 and authors' names, is also included. Twelve volumes
                 (containing over 30 000 references) have been prepared
                 since 1970 by use of computer typesetting techniques.
                 The present production system is based on an FR80
                 microfilm recorder which employs special circuitry to
                 display proportionally spaced text at high speed using
                 a serifed font. Programs have been developed for

                 study of the correlation between picture elements, it

                 on three neighboring screen dots. Based on this
                 finding, an adaptive predictive split coding method is
                 developed which predicts and encodes screen dot image
                 data and character image data according to the most
                 adaptive reference picture elements. This coding method

                 prevent reduction of the compression factor when
                 different kinds of data are used. It proves to be a

                 devices in the form of dot arrays. Some character sets
                 may be held in random access memory and thus be loaded
                 dynamically from a user's definitions, but it remains
                 the case that the character generator logic is
                 relatively small compared with everything else. Indeed,
                 this is increasingly true with more and more upmarket
                 displays --- most of the increased function being
                 devoted to picture storage and manipulation. A binary
                 dot array is not in fact the best way to render a
                 letterform on a CRT display. The dottiness produces a
                 pretty crude and unsatisfactory image which is ugly and
                 often hard to read. Raster displays do, it is true,
                 tend always to be seen showing dotty and ugly pictures
                 but diagrams are not intended for `reading' in quite
                 the same manner as running text. Fortunately, this
                 dottiness is not intrinsic and solutions are known for
                 arbitrary images, including text. Quite stunning
                 improvements can be achieved by simple methods which
                 can be cheaply implemented for character displays. This
                 paper discusses the techniques and presents a complete
                 alphabet definition as an example of the method in
                 use.",

  abstract =     "A low-cost optical character recognition (OCR) system
                 can be realized by means of a document scanner
                 connected to a CPU through an interface. The interface
                 performs elementary image processing functions, such as
                 noise filtering and thresholding of the video image
                 from the scanner. The processor receives a binary image
                 of the document, formats the image into individual
                 character patterns, and classifies the patterns
                 one-by-one. A CPU implementation is highly flexible and
                 avoids much of the development and manufacturing costs
                 for special-purpose, parallel circuitry typically used
                 in commercial OCR. A processor-based recognition system
                 has been investigated for reading documents printed in
                 fixed-pitch conventional type fonts, such as occur in
                 routine office typing. Novel, efficient methods for
                 tracking a print line, resolving it into individual
                 character patterns, detecting underscores, and
                 eliminating noise have been devised. A previously
                 developed classification technique, based on decision
                 trees, has been extended in order to improve reading
                 accuracy in an environment of considerable character
                 variation, including the possibility that documents in
                 the same font style may be produced using quite
                 different print technologies.",

                 plane. These points are normally provided as input by

                 electrophotographic printers is achieved by use of a
                 fundamentally different control system than was used in
                 their predecessors, the Models 1 and 2. As a result,
                 printing of composed pages or electronic overlays can
                 include text of many different font sizes and styles
                 printed in multiple orientations, as well as raster
                 images up to a full page in size. The printers manage
                 stored resources, including fonts, segments of pages,
                 and electronic overlays. Pages are composed inside the
                 printers in a logical sequence, instead of by the more
                 traditional line-by-line sequence. This, as well as the
                 capability to position text and images at any
                 addressable point, enhances usability. A high-speed,
                 table-driven character generator, a new command set,
                 and a microcoded control unit make all of this

                 the family is the ability to print at 200 characters
                 per second (cps) on one-to-six-part forms up to 400 mm
                 (15. 75 inches) wide. The standard symbol font is
                 designed to a 9 multiplied by 12 symbol cell matrix,
                 with a horizontal and vertical resolution of 90 dots
                 per inch (dpi). All three of the printers have the
                 ability to print graphics at 21,600 dots per second.

                 the printers --- Courier (serif) and Cubic (sans
                 serif). In addition, there are three standard pitches

                 permits formatting of text involving a mixture of
                 languages written from left to right and from right to
                 left, such as English and Hebrew. The programs are
                 table driven or macro-generated to permit them to be
                 used for any languages written from left to right and
                 from right to left so long as fonts with the proper
                 character sets can be mounted on a typesetting device
                 supported by DITROFF. The preprocessors are set up to
                 permit phonetic, unidirectional input of all of the
                 alphabets needed using only the two alphabets (each
                 case counts as an alphabet) available on the input

                 rules about a letter's form, depending on its position
                 in the word, and the language of the user's input
                 keyboard. The postprocessor is set up to properly
                 change direction of formatting when the text switches
                 to a language written in a different direction. The
                 collection of programs is also designed to allow use of

                 An alternative design philosophy provides comparable
                 video quality but compromises retrieval time (seconds
                 instead of milliseconds). The design includes dual
                 microprocessors, compressed high speed memory (run
                 length encoded), a simplified data structure (to
                 minimize video generation hardware), and an integral PC

                 salient features of the Cedar programming environment,
                 a state-of- the-art programming system that combines in
                 a single integrated environment: high quality graphics,
                 a sophisticated editor and document preparation
                 facility, and a variety of tools for the programmer to
                 use in the construction and debugging of his programs.
                 The Cedar programming language is a strongly typed,
                 compiler-oriented language of the Pascal family. What
                 is especially interesting about the Cedar project is
                 that it is one of the few examples where an
                 interactive, experimental programming environment has
                 been built for this kind of language. In the past, such
                 environments have been confined to dynamically typed
                 languages like Lisp and Smalltalk. The paper attempts
                 to give the reader the feel of the Cedar system by
                 simulating a live demonstration. The demonstration is
                 actually taken from a video tape of such a live demo;
                 the sequence of events, as well as the dialog, is
                 fairly close to what a viewer of this tape would see
                 and hear. Numerous snapshots of the display taken at
                 various points during the session simulate the visual
                 information contained in the tape. Text that would
                 actually appear on the display during the demonstration
                 - either because the user typed it or the system
                 printed it - will appear in this paper in a
                 distinguished font. The explanations that the
                 demonstrator would give will be in the normal font.
                 Comments that would be distracting during a live
                 demonstration but are appropriate for the paper are
                 included as footnotes.",

                 see is what you get' system. The paper will begin by
                 defining a `what you see is what you get' system and
                 briefly discussing some possible ways of approaching
                 the issue. Then the implementation of the WYSIWYG
                 system on Apple's Lisa computer will be used as the
                 vehicle to explain what the design decisions were
                 regarding the type and why they were made. The methods
                 used to achieve the visual fidelity of the typography
                 across devices will be explained as they impact the
                 design decisions that had to be made. The design
                 decisions involve issues about the type model used,
                 methods of matching, fixed pitch fonts, tuning, and
                 device dependency. The WYSIWYG system was successful on
                 the Lisa, but the process was time intensive and not
                 suited for expansion. The author was directly involved
                 in the implementation of the Lisa system as the lead
                 type designer.",

                 matches to a very small number, based on the detection
                 of very simple features which must be present in any

                 candidates is further reduced by determining whether
                 certain slightly more complex features are present

                 of the candidate(s) by correlating the curve segments

                 translation, interpretive, editing and monitoring tools
                 in an undergraduate software engineering course.
                 Students used the tools on low-cost workstations
                 (Macintoshes) to build large, group projects. The
                 students' projects used all available features of
                 workstation environments, including graphics, windows,
                 fonts, mice, networks, and sound generators. We found
                 that (1) the use of tools increased student
                 productivity, (2) a shift in a data structure and
                 algorithm topics is needed to cover material relevant
                 for workstation environments, (3) new topics in system
                 design are required for a workstation environment, (4)
                 traditional material can be easily illustrated with a
                 workstation environment and (5) students enjoyed being
                 able to manipulate the advanced features of
                 workstations in their work, which in turn increased
                 their motivation for and concentration on the course

                 pattern-matching approach is used. Essentially, a set

                 descriptors, location functions, and the manner in
                 which they are combined to exploit the topological
                 structure of characters. By virtue of the new pattern

                 order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning
                 and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph
                 of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The

                 are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier.

                 choice correct performance on mixtures of six
                 dissimilar fonts, and over 99\% on most single fonts,

                 of different typefaces. Implementations of typefaces
                 are commonly referred to as fonts. Typically, sets of
                 fonts used in an EPS come from different sources, i.e.
                 vendors, and they use different encoding mappings, e.g.
                 ASCII, XCl, EBCIDIC, etc. Furthermore, a logical font
                 which the user uses or sees may be based on a different
                 number of machine (printer or typesetter) fonts. In an
                 EPS system fonts must be handled in such a way to
                 shield the user from such idiosyncrasies and also to
                 make tasks of document composition and typesetting as
                 efficient as possible. This paper treats such problems
                 and proposes a solution for handling of fonts for the

                 availability of machine-readable files of books
                 previously available mainly in paper form. Systems to
                 provide end users electronic access to the full text of
                 books seem a real possibility. Based on an OCLC study
                 of the use and users of nonfiction books in a public
                 library, this paper identifies design considerations
                 for systems that offer access to full-text nonfiction
                 databases. The study focused on features that public
                 library patrons use in selecting nonfiction books and
                 for finding specific information. The study's results
                 suggest that providing subject access for selecting
                 nonfiction, displaying or highlighting new
                 acquisitions, and facilitating known-item searches will
                 all be important for end users to access the full text
                 of nonfiction books. Since the study found browsing to
                 be the most popular method for selecting a given book
                 and for finding specific information, electronic
                 information systems should allow rapid scanning and

                 B{\'e}zier and B-spline curves and surfaces used in
                 computer-aided geometric design are not as simple as
                 they should be, because there is no easy way to tell,
                 from the labels in the diagrams, what geometric
                 relationships hold among the labeled points. This paper
                 proposes a new labeling scheme, based on the work of
                 P.{\~{}}de{\~{}}Casteljau. The key idea is a classical
                 mathematical principle, which we christen the
                 Blossoming Principle: a univariate polynomial of degree
                 n is equivalent to a symmetric polynomial in n
                 variables that is linear in each variable separately.
                 Blossoming a B{\'e}zier curve or surface provides lucid
                 labels both for its B{\'e}zier points and for all of
                 the intermediate points that arise in the de Casteljau
                 Algorithm. Blossoming a spline curve with parametric
                 continuity provides lucid labels for its de Boor points
                 and for the points that arise in the de Boor Algorithm.
                 Spline curves with geometric continuity and spline
                 surfaces with triangular patches present unsolved
                 labeling challenges, however. consists of a sequence of
                 B{\'e}zier (i.e., parametric polynomial) curve segments
                 meeting at joints with some degree of continuity.
                 Spline curves and the analogous spline surfaces are
                 commonly used in computer aided design to model curved
                 shapes ranging from typographic fonts to automobile
                 bodies. This paper presents a new perspective on
                 B{\'e}zier curves and splines based on a one-to-one
                 correspondence between univariate polynomials of degree
                 k and symmetric k-variate polynomials of degree one in
                 each variable. The author uses this perspective to
                 derive the standard constructions for B{\'e}zier curves
                 and splines in a manner that gives perspicuous labels
                 to the points arising at all the steps of these
                 constructions; to elucidate the conditions that govern
                 the degree of continuity achieved at the joints of
                 splines; and to explore a variety of related topics,
                 including spline surfaces, geometric continuity, and
                 piecewise parametric rational curves. The text is
                 intended to be self-contained, requiring no previous
                 study of the theory of splines, and it succeeds in this
                 goal. The key ideas are carefully introduced, examined
                 from multiple points of view, and illustrated with
                 numerous figures and examples. The text does, however,
                 demand of the reader a certain ability to deal
                 comfortably with mathematical abstractions -- the
                 quality that my college math professors referred to as
                 ``mathematical maturity.'' In return, it offers not
                 only considerable insight into the theory of
                 B{\'e}ziers and splines, but also a variety of
                 interesting mathematical sidelights, such as an unusual
                 proof of the theorem that the medians of a triangle
                 trisect each other (Exercise 7.7a: Generalize this
                 proof to higher dimensions) and a discussion of
                 Zeeman's ``umbilic bracelet'' (characterizing the set
                 of cubics with three real roots). Jim Saxe",

                 and printing the index for a book or a manual. The
                 input consists of lines containing index terms and page
                 numbers. The programs collect multiple occurrences of
                 the same terms, compress runs of page numbers, create
                 permutations (e.g., `index, book' from `book index'),
                 and sort them into proper alphabetic order. The
                 programs can cope with embedded formatting commands
                 (size and font changes, etc.), with roman numeral page
                 numbers, and with {\bf see} terms. The programs do not
                 help with the original creation of index terms. The
                 implementation runs on the UNIX\reg{} operating system.
                 It uses a long pipeline of short {\bf awk} programs
                 rather than a single program in a conventional
                 language. This structure makes the programs easy to
                 adapt or augment to meet special requirements that
                 arise in different indexing styles. The programs were
                 intended to be used with {\bf troff}, but can be used
                 with a formatter like {\TeX} with minor changes. An

                 based on binary images fails when very small characters
                 are analyzed. Size invariance is achieved in two ways.
                 A coarse scaling is determined by the Laplacian
                 pyramid. Taking the appropriate level, the variation of
                 size is within a factor of two. Complete size
                 invariance is achieved by the specific choice of the
                 features themselves, which are weighed distributions of
                 directions and direction changes. These features are
                 also comparatively invariant to different fonts but
                 quite specific to the basic structure of a character.",

                 structure and parameters derived using optimal
                 detection theory. The second method makes use of the
                 learning vector quantization self-organizing networks
                 of T. Kohonen (Self-Organization and Associative
                 Memory, Springer-Verlag, 1988). Experimental results

                 diagram of nodes connected by lines. These diagrams

                 This paper describes an alternate visual representation
                 for navigating knowledge structures, based on a virtual
                 museum metaphor. This representation uses nested boxes
                 rather than linked nodes to represent relations. The
                 intricate structure of the knowledge base is conveyed
                 by a combination of position, size, color, and font
                 cues. MUE (Museum Unit Editor) was implemented using

                 complication when a Japanese DTP system is formed.
                 Though the concept of DTP was recently introduced in
                 Japan, numerous electronic publishing systems like
                 computerized type-setting system (CTS) have been used
                 for preparation of block copies and page compositions
                 since late 1970s. 1989 is considered the first year of
                 DTP since binary script software systems similar to
                 PostScript and laser printers with >400 dpi and
                 built-in kanji fonts based on medium-to-small sized
                 computers began to appear in the local market. For
                 example, a NEC 9801 based system with a 480 dpi laser

  abstract =     "A new system for the recognition of a multifont
                 photoscript Arabic text is introduced. The
                 distinguishing feature of such text is that it is
                 written cursively. This imposes an additional
                 requirement of isolating each character or set of
                 overlapping characters before recognition. The proposed
                 system is composed of three interleaved phases. The
                 segmentation phase attempts to produce an initial set
                 of characters from the connected text according to a
                 set of predefined rules. The output is then passed to a
                 preliminary classification phase that attempts to label
                 the unknown characters into one of ten possible classes
                 according to a set of rules that acquire their
                 parameter values through learning. The last phase
                 contains a more elaborate set of rules that recognize
                 characters within each class. This recognition phase is
                 designed to allow errors during segmentation and\slash
                 or classification to be rectified through an adaptive
                 recognition technique. The system has been implemented
                 and tested on several fonts with a recognition rate of
                 130 words\slash min and an error rate of less than

                 Model H-H2 by Hogg and Hubermann have been successfully
                 applied to recognize 26 English capital letters, each
                 with six font representations. These two models are
                 very similar, but Model H-H2 has the capability for
                 modification of the basins of attraction during the
                 training phase, whereas Model H-H1 does not. This
                 appears to be a desirable feature for a neural network.
                 It is shown in this work that this is indeed true. In
                 either model, it is difficult to find a single set of
                 parameters for one network or memory that can
                 distinguish all of the characters. Therefore, a cascade
                 of memories is utilized. Thus, in the training phase, a
                 decision tree is built by cascading the memory matrices
                 that represent the models. That is successive layers of
                 refinement in selection of basins of attraction are
                 used to generate output patterns unique to each input
                 pattern. In the recognition phase, the subject
                 characters are recognized by searching in the tree.
                 Model parameters such as memory array size, S${}_{min}$
                 S${}_{max}$, and M${}_{min}$ M${}_{max}$ were varied to
                 elucidate the models' behavior. It is shown that there
                 exist parameter values for both models to achieve a
                 100\% recognition rate when all six fonts are used both
                 as the training and the recognition set. Model H-H2
                 significantly outperformed Model H-H1 in terms of
                 recognition rate, use of memory space, and learning
                 speed when all six fonts were used as the training

                 character scaling, which is an important issue in
                 typesetting and graphical text. An algorithm for
                 digital character scaling by a contour method is
                 developed and implemented. The algorithm is based on
                 scaling the contour of the character through a
                 transformation. Cubic splines are used to interpolate
                 the discrete samples of the contour character. Final
                 results show no jaggies. The algorithm is applied to
                 Arabic fonts and compared to two other algorithms:
                 replication and telescoping template. The superior
                 performance of the contour method is attributed to the
                 cubic spline fitting, which gives better smoothness to
                 the edge of the character.",

                 Engineering of Visual Display Workstations specifies
                 that character height-to-width ratios be within the
                 range of 1:0.7 to 1:0.9. The empirical literature,
                 however, fails to provide unequivocal support for that
                 requirement. In designing CRT displays there is a
                 complex interaction among several parameters, including
                 character aspect ratio and character height. The
                 present study compared a font with a character aspect
                 ratio within the range allowed by ANSI\slash HFS
                 100-1988 to a font with a character aspect ratio
                 outside that range. Using three different
                 visually-intensive tasks, no real performance
                 differences between the two fonts were observed. The
                 study demonstrated that meeting individual design
                 specifications, such as those provided in ANSI\slash
                 HFS 100-1988, does not necessarily produce the most
                 legible character set. It is argued that a
                 performance-based compliance procedure may allow more

                 However, use of double-pixel-width characters can
                 substantially reduce reading errors when
                 noncatastrophic dot-matrix display failures occur.
                 Using a single-pixel-width font as a reference, an
                 enhanced, 7 \$MUL@ 9 matrix size, two-pixel-width

                 contains an introductory chapter for the beginner, its
                 main purpose is to give the reader advanced information
                 on {\LaTeX} (and partially on {\TeX}) in order to
                 prepare sophisticated macros, style files, and to make
                 a clever use of fonts. Here is a reduced table of
                 contents (translated to English): Chapter 1 -

                 The publisher received camera-ready pages that were
                 prepared by the author with a 300-dpi laser printer.
                 The page style dimensions were suitably enlarged while
                 the photo plates were reduced so as to minimize the
                 granulosity of the signs. In practice the book was
                 prepared with 12pt option and reduced by the
                 photografic ratio of 0.8 so that the final real font
                 size is 9.6pt. The whole book was prepared with the
                 standard Computer Roman fonts on purpose in order to
                 show the potential user what he can get with a standard
                 \TeX{}/\LaTeX{} kit. The simple pictures were prepared
                 with the ``picture'' environment. The cover and the
                 title page were designed by a graphic expert of the
                 publishing company.",

                 represented in terms of their logical structure rather
                 than their appearance. Nevertheless most of the popular
                 document processing systems concentrate on appearance
                 rather than structure, mainly because most users opt
                 for a user interface that is interactive, simple and
                 direct. This paper considers issues related to fonts
                 and other appearance attributes within hypertext
                 documents. It first presents the relevant differences
                 between hypertext systems and document preparation
                 systems whose end product is paper. It then goes on to
                 describe a scheme for representing appearance through
                 logical structure. The scheme aims to meet the extra
                 needs of hypertext systems, and yet still to be simple
                 enough to attract wide usage.",

                 identifying the different components of the programs,

                 components, and for explaining the components and the

                 MacWrite. The system distinguishes code from prose by
                 the fonts that they are written in, uses boxes for
                 abstracting and structuring code, and employs ports for
                 generating different views of the code. (19 Refs.)",

                 There are three different methods available for getting
                 alphabets into digital form: hand-digitizing,
                 auto-tracing and direct design on a workstation screen.
                 The advent of intelligent font scaling requires us to
                 ensure the `optical' quality of a font and also the
                 `numerical' quality of its data; this, in turn, means
                 that new procedures have to be added to the font
                 production process. Furthermore, a given typeface has
                 to be rendered on a wide variety of output devices
                 ranging from computer displays, printers (dot-matrix,
                 laser, inkjet or thermal-transfer) and typesetters (CRT
                 or laser) to the more exotic devices such as plotters,
                 vinyl-cutters and routers. To deal with this it is
                 necessary to set up a database of font data, in a
                 machine-independent format such as IKARUS\@. This
                 enables us to cope with the long life cycles of
                 typefaces and also to serve present and future
                 applications by converting the IKARUS data into various

                 pieces of information (text, figures, pictures, etc.)
                 so that the reader can follow many different paths
                 corresponding to lines of thoughts, levels of
                 description, levels of details, and so on. One of the
                 main problems in using hypertext systems is the
                 navigation problem [Ni90a]. Users tend to get lost
                 partly because the information they are reading can
                 have a complicated structure which is usually unknown
                 to them. We study in this paper a technique to help
                 users orient themselves by a quick browsing, which we
                 call flying, through hypertext. The first thing many
                 people do when given a new book is flip through the
                 pages to get a first impression of the book. Quite a
                 bit of information can be gained by this quick informal
                 evaluation. First, just the size of the book is a good
                 indicator. A ten-page brochure is treated differently
                 than a 500-page instruction manual. The book's density
                 (how many characters per page), its layout (e.g., the
                 font, the percentage of pictures), the technical
                 content (e.g., number of equations, number of technical
                 drawings), familiar features (e.g., pictures or
                 drawings that the reader has seen elsewhere), just to
                 name a few simple things that can be determined
                 quickly, all give us important information about the
                 book without reading even one sentence. This kind of
                 information is not immediately available in hypertext,
                 and we believe that the lack of it contributes to the
                 navigation problem. We would like to provide this type
                 of information in a quick and flexible way. We describe
                 in this paper a tool for flying through hypertext
                 systems and discuss the issues involved in its
                 implementation. Our tool is analogous to flipping the
                 pages of a book with one notable exception: the
                 flipping is not necessarily in a linear order. The
                 variability of the links and the structure that they
                 provide enable flexible flipping in many different
                 orders controlled by the reader. The key to any
                 flipping is speed. The goal is not to digest the
                 contents of the pages, but rather to gain some insight
                 to features such as organization, size, depth, level,
                 detail, and so on. Another analogy is to seeing a
                 movie, or better yet a videodisk, in fast forward.
                 There are certain characteristics of the movie that can
                 be studied better that way. Flying can also be used to
                 move fast from one place to another in the hypertext
                 following a certain order or traversal. Flying is not
                 intended to replace any of the other navigation tools;
                 it is an additional tool.",

                 numerical computations based on the interval approach.
                 It is managed by an international editorial board from
                 Bulgaria, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United
                 States, and printed in Russia. The journal includes
                 various items in the fields of theoretical research,
                 computer tools, applications, interdisciplinary
                 research and other relevant areas. The IC has been
                 prepared with {\TeX} since 1992. Recently a new style
                 has been designed based on standard {\LaTeX \tt
                 article} style with changes in fonts, headings layout,
                 running heads etc. It uses 10.8pt Baskerville for body
                 text (the unusual font size is selected for better
                 wedding with CM math) and horizontally-squeezed
                 Palatino for headings. For mathematical formulae,
                 standard Computer Modern is preserved. Proofs are made
                 using em{\TeX} DVIHPLJ on a Hewlett--Packard LaserJet
                 IIIp, and final pages are printed at 600dpi. Using
                 V{\TeX} is now under consideration. Papers are accepted

                 activities, including the production of new fonts,
                 pictures and extended production systems. The project
                 discussed was aimed at rescuing the full power of
                 {\TeX} packages in the newly emerging X-Windows
                 technological context. The authors describe software
                 which was produced to take full advantage of the
                 facilities of both systems by translating {\TeX} output
                 into bit-mapped images which can then be displayed on
                 an X-terminal and mixed with such facilities as the
                 extra fonts available and bit-maps produced in the
                 X-environment. An interactive environment is defined
                 that gives the user flexibility in the creation of a
                 document of high quality with a friendly human-computer
                 interface, which allows the windowing environment to
                 give a new look to an old and well-tried system. (4

                 It was typeset by the author using Plain {\TeX} plus
                 specially written macros. The code for all macros used
                 for the book are reproduced in it so that the book

                 specifications, fonts used, and so on---about its own
                 typesetting. Over half the book consists of {\TeX}
                 input and output shown side-by-side, providing an
                 explicit example of how a part of the book was typeset.

                 production department of Academic Press. The diagrams
                 were drawn using {\LaTeX}. Sample printouts of pages
                 were made on various laser printers. When everything
                 seemed satisfactory, the dvi files were copied onto IBM
                 diskettes and were mailed to Academic Press, and from
                 them to the American Mathematical Society. The final
                 copy was produced by the A.M.S. using an APS micro-5
                 phototypesetter. All fonts used in the book are from
                 the Computer Modern family. Parts of the covers of the
                 book, inside and outside, were done in {\TeX} by the
                 author (the code for this is not included in the book).
                 The outside cover was designed by Camille Pecoul of
                 Academic Press and produced at Allison Associates in
                 Boston. The font used for the title (on the covers) is
                 Meridien. The background pattern was obtained by
                 shooting a handmade marble paper as a black-and-white
                 halftone and then overprinting with the Pantone
                 Matching System (PMS). The placement of material on the
                 cover was done by hand by Ms. Pecoul using a mechanical
                 board. The drop shadow effect was done at Allison
                 Associates.",

                 labeling of various consumer products, and over the
                 counter and prescription drugs. The purpose of the
                 present research was to examine certain variables that
                 are associated with legibility, namely font type, font
                 weight, point size, and point size contrast between the
                 signal word and the main body of the warning. A sample
                 of undergraduate students and elderly people rated 24
                 Ultra Tide detergent labels for their likelihood to
                 read the warning, the saliency of the warning, and
                 readability of the warning. The results indicated that
                 participants were more likely to read the warning in
                 Helvetica type than in Times or Goudy. Times was more
                 likely to be read than Goudy. Bold type was more likely
                 to be read than Roman type. There was a greater
                 likelihood of reading the warning when the main body
                 was in 10 point size as compared to 8 point size. A 2
                 point size difference between the signal word and the
                 main body of the warning produced a greater likelihood
                 of reading the warning over a 4 point size difference.
                 One possibility for this result is that the 4 point
                 difference minimizes the importance of the main body of
                 the warning, therefore making only the signal word
                 salient.",

  abstract =     "Generalization for production is a difficult problem
                 solved by intelligent systems. One such problem might
                 be `paint a portrait of George Bush in the style of
                 Vincent van Gogh.' In these tasks, a low dimensional
                 representation ('George Bush' and `style of van Gogh')
                 is expanded into a (nonunique) output of extremely high
                 dimension, for instance represented by color, line,
                 shading, etc. We designed a connectionist network for
                 generalization of production in such a way --- to
                 generate letterforms in a new font given just a few
                 exemplars from that font. During learning, our network
                 constructs distributed internal representations of
                 different fonts and letters, even though each training
                 instance had both font characteristics and letter
                 characteristics. Separate hidden representations for
                 `letter' and `font' were necessary for success of the
                 network. The integration of information from font and
                 letter representations had to be at a proper,
                 intermediate level of abstraction. The limitations of
                 the network can be attributed, in part, to limited
                 training corpus, and lack of translation and scale
                 invariances.",

  abstract =     "Forward differencing is widely used to generate
                 rapidly large numbers of points at equally space
                 parameter values along a curve. A failing of forward
                 differencing is the tendency to generate many
                 extraneous points for curves with highly nonuniform
                 parameterizations. A key result is presented and
                 proven, namely, that a few levels of subdivision, prior
                 to initialization for forward differencing, can improve
                 substantially the quality of the step size estimate,
                 resulting in very few extra points. The initial
                 subdivisions can be done without loss of the exact
                 integer precision available in forward differencing.
                 For small numbers of points---a common occurrence in
                 fonts---exact subdivision is even faster than exact
                 forward differencing. When exact subdivision is used in
                 conjunction with a previously presented exact
                 forward-differencing algorithm, arbitrary cubic curves
                 may be rendered with 32-bit arithmetic and guaranteed
                 single-pixel accuracy, in a grid with an address space
                 as large as 0..7281, with no two generated points
                 greater than one pixel apart. This is more steps than
                 previously possible. Previous discussions of rendering
                 using subdivision have concentrated not on distance but
                 on straightness estimates, whereby subdivision can be
                 stopped once a subcurve can be drawn safely using its
                 polygonal approximation. In this article, bounds are
                 also derived on the size of the control polygon after
                 multiple levels of subdivision: these are used to
                 determine bounds on the number of steps required for
                 differencing. It is shown that any curve whose
                 rasterization fits in a space of $ \omega $ pixels
                 requires no more than $ 9 \omega $ steps.",

                 triples of points that satisfy five simple axioms
                 obeyed by the `counterclockwise' relation on points in
                 the plane. A CCC system is a relation on ordered
                 quadruples, satisfying five simple axioms obeyed by the
                 `incircle' relation. In this monograph, the properties
                 of these axioms are developed and related to other
                 abstract notions such as oriented matroids, chirotopes,
                 primitive sorting networks, and arrangements of
                 pseudolines. Decision procedures based on the CC axioms
                 turn out to be NP-complete, although nice
                 characterizations of CC structures are available.
                 Efficient algorithms are presented for finding convex
                 hulls in any CC system and Delaunay triangulations in
                 any CCC system. Practical methods for satisfying the
                 axioms with arbitrarily degenerate data lead to what
                 may well be the best method now known for Delaunay
                 triangulations and Voronoi diagrams in the Euclidean
                 plane. The underlying theme of this work is a
                 philosophy of algorithm design based on simple
                 primitive operations that satisfy clear and concise
                 axioms. (72 Refs.)",

                 interesting to typography buffs as well as to computer
                 scientists, because of the rapid turnaround time
                 provided by Springer-Verlag. It is the first
                 publication to use the final revision of the Computer
                 Modern typefaces, released two weeks ago. I made the
                 arrowheads longer and stronger, so that they will not
                 disappear so easily on xerox copies; and I redesigned a
                 few of the letterforms, such as {$ {\cal I} $}, {$
                 {\cal T} $}, and $ \delta $. There is also an improved
                 method for digitization at low resolution. The new
                 characters do not affect any of the line breaks or page
                 breaks made by {\TeX}, because they fit exactly into
                 the same size boxes as the old ones did. Everyone now
                 using the Computer Modern fonts of 1986 should soon be
                 able to install the 1992 fonts in their place, at
                 little or no cost. I promise not the change them again.

  abstract =     "This paper describes an Arabic formatting system that
                 is able for format multilingual scientific documents,
                 containing text in Arabic or Persian, as well as other
                 languages, plus pictures, graphs, formulae, tables,
                 bibliographical citations, and bibliographies. The
                 system is an extension of {\tt ditroff\slash ffortid}
                 that is already capable of handling Hebrew in the
                 context of multilingual scientific documents. {\tt
                 ditroff\slash ffortid} itself is a collection of pre-
                 and postprocessors for the UNIX {\tt ditroff} (Device
                 Independent Typesetter RunOFF) formatter. The new
                 system is built without changing {\tt ditroff} itself.
                 The extension consists of a new preprocessor, fonts,
                 and a modified existing postprocessor. The preprocessor
                 transliterates from a phonetic rendition of Arabic
                 using only the two cases of the Latin alphabet. The
                 preprocessor assigns a position, stand-alone,
                 connected-previous, connected-after, or connected-both,
                 to each letter. It recognizes ligatures and assigns
                 vertical positions from a standard Arabic keyboard
                 using the standard ASMO encoding. In any case, the
                 output has each positioned letter or ligature and each
                 diacritical mark encoded according to the font's
                 encoding scheme. The fonts are assumed to be designed
                 to connect letters that should be connected when they
                 are printed adjacent to each other. The postprocessor
                 is an enhancement of the {\tt ffortid} program that
                 arranges for right-to-left printing of identified
                 right-to-left fonts. The major enhancement is
                 stretching final letters of lines or words instead of
                 inserting extra inter-word spaces, in order to justify
                 the text. As a self-test, this paper was formatted
                 using the described system, and it contains many
                 examples of text written in Arabic, Hebrew, and
                 English.",

                 pattern recognition. Whether it is good or not affects
                 the recognition rate seriously. Selecting the strokes
                 as the features to describe a Chinese character is
                 indeed a powerful approach. But it also suffers from
                 the difficulty of stroke extraction. In this paper,
                 some knowledge about strokes is derived by studying the
                 structure of Chinese characters. This knowledge is then
                 applied to help extract the strokes. The method cannot
                 only heuristically extract strokes but can also
                 heuristically eliminate noises including those added to
                 strokes for artistic sake. Moreover, this method does
                 not use any preprocessing like thinning or other
                 transformations, so its extraction speed is very
                 fast.",

                 the papers presented during the third Raster Imaging
                 and Digital Typography conference, held at Darmstadt,
                 Germany, from 11 to 13 April 1994. Earlier conferences
                 in the series took place in 1989 at Lausanne,
                 Switzerland (organized by Roger D. Hersch, EPFL) and in
                 1991 at Boston, Massachussets (organized by Robert A.
                 Morris, University of Massachussets at Boston). The
                 corresponding proceedings are published by Cambridge
                 University Press (see below). Digital typography is a
                 relatively new field: the first commercial
                 cathode-ray-tube photo\-composing machine appeared in
                 1966. Since that time, the field has been growing very
                 fast, and is still active. During the RIDT'89
                 conference, emphasis was laid on the rasterisation of
                 outline characters and on rendering techniques. RIDT'91
                 concentrated more on digital halftoning and on
                 greyscale characters. However, both of these
                 conferences bore in mind that beyond the mathematics of
                 shapes and their rendering, printing types exist with
                 their own aesthetic rules. That is why the
                 presentations were made by a mix of technologists,
                 scientists and designers. The RIDT'94 programme
                 committee tried to attract a similar mix of papers when
                 this conference was launched. As expected, the fields
                 have moved on since the last conference, but we hope
                 that the selected papers adequately exhibit the present
                 state of the art in raster imaging and digital
                 typography. In the recent past, formal research in
                 digital typography has dealt with graphical algorithms,
                 such as the rendering of outline characters and the
                 generation of outline characters from bit-mapped
                 drawings, to name but two. Present research focuses on
                 models and methods for concise but precise font
                 description and modelling. That trend began in industry
                 with font interpolation programs and font systems such
                 as Adobe Systems' Multiple Master technology. This
                 research definitively belongs to computer science, with
                 keywords such as {\em object orientation}, {\em regular
                 expressions}, {\em string matching\/} and {\em shape
                 parameterization}. A look at related fields, such as
                 computer-aided design, shows that there still remains
                 plenty of mathematical research to be done in digital
                 typography. Mathematics is already used in CAD to
                 express aesthetic criteria, both at the local
                 (individual curves/surfaces) and the global level, for
                 ensuring overall appearance and design consistency.

                 potential keywords are extracted from the image using a
                 morphology-based preprocessor. Feature vectors based on
                 the external shape and internal structure of the word
                 are computed over vertical columns of pixels in a word
                 bounding box. For each user-specified keyword, an HMM
                 is created by concatenating appropriate
                 context-dependent character HMMs. Non-keywords are
                 modeled using an HMM based on context-dependent
                 sub-character models. Keyword spotting is performed

                 by connecting the keyword and non-keyword HMMs in
                 parallel. Applications of word-image spotting include

                 weights, condensed or expanded versions, small caps as
                 well as optically scaled fonts. The tool used to
                 parametrize PostScript fonts is D.~E. Knuth's {\MF}
                 program. Instead of designing a font from scratch,
                 {\MF} is used as an extrapolator of existing PostScript
                 fonts: out of the information contained in them we
                 build a meta-font; for every choice of parameter
                 values, special versions of {\MF} allow us to return to
                 PostScript and produce a new PostScript font.",

                 character shapes given as outlines. The obvious
                 scan-conversion process does not produce acceptable
                 results unless important features such as stem widths
                 are carefully controlled during the scan-conversion
                 process. This paper describes a method for
                 automatically extracting the necessary feature
                 information and generating high-quality bitmaps without
                 resorting to hand editing. Almost all of the work is
                 done in a preprocessing step, the result of which is an
                 intermediate form that can be quickly converted into
                 bitmaps once the font size and device resolution are
                 known. A heuristically defined system of linear
                 equations describes how the ideal outlines should be
                 distorted in order to produce the best possible results
                 when scan converted in a straightforward manner. The
                 Lovasz basis reduction algorithm then reduces the
                 system of equations to a form that makes it easy to
                 find an approximate solution subject to the constraint
                 that some variables must be integers. The heuristic
                 information is of such a general nature that it applies

  abstract =     "Character placement in digital typography is commonly
                 defined in terms of a set of parameters (font metrics)
                 that specify the relative locations of the local
                 coordinate systems of adjacent characters in a line of
                 text. The primary font metrics for horizontal letter
                 spacing are the character set widths and sidebearings
                 and the character pair spacing adjustments (kerning
                 terms). A typical parameter for vertical alignment is
                 the character depth below baseline. This paper
                 discusses the problem of determining font metrics from
                 measurements on images of typeset text and develops
                 least-squares procedures for font metric estimation.
                 When it is known that kerning is not present,
                 sidebearing estimation involves solving a set of linear
                 equations, called the sidebearing normal equations,
                 More generally, simultaneous sidebearing and kerning
                 term estimation involves an iterative procedure in
                 which a modified set of sidebearing normal equations is
                 solved during each iteration. Character depth estimates
                 are obtained by solving a set of baseline normal
                 equations. In a preliminary evaluation of the proposed
                 procedures on scanned text images in three fonts the
                 root-mean-square set width estimation error was about
                 0.2 pixel. A novel application of font metric
                 estimation to text image editing is discussed.",

                 means of communication, starting with hand-set metal
                 type and mechanical typesetting in hot metal.
                 Present-day techniques of phototypesetting, and of
                 digital typesetting, via cathode-ray tube and laser
                 machines, are also discussed. Careful attention is paid
                 to the cultural impact of these techniques, with
                 particular reference to traditional French typefaces
                 which often have small x-height and very thin hairlines
                 (which can disappear at small point sizes). Reference
                 is also made to the impact of each of these modern
                 typesetting methods on both `informational' and
                 `cultural' texts. A strong argument is presented that a
                 nation's typefaces encapsulate its national spirit and
                 its culture. For this reason, it is regrettable that
                 the advent of laser-driven imaging devices has brought
                 with it an `anglicization' of many fonts, via an
                 increase in x-height, and a reluctance to countenance a
                 non-linear variation of letterforms and set-width with
                 point size \emdash{} a characteristic so crucial to the
                 readability of classic texts. A plea is made for the
                 rapidly developing computer technology to be deployed
                 in the interests of {\em quality\/} as well as {\em
                 quantity}. Modern techniques have all the advantages of
                 photographic sharpness but this must be harnessed to
                 the traditional subtleties of the original typeface
                 design if the intentions, and the cultural identity, of
                 the typeface designer are to be truly respected.",

                 sheet transformation and its use as a tool in an
                 interactive font design environment. The designer works
                 with graph-paper-like orthogonal grids and applies the
                 rubber sheet transformation to the gridspace to obtain
                 new shapes. Further, he or she may subsequently work on
                 the transformed gridspace to fine-tune the shapes. A
                 computationally efficient deformation mapping technique
                 for use in such an interactive design environment has
                 been presented. An important feature is that the order
                 of the high-level outline definitions of the deformed
                 shape is the same as that of the original design.The
                 shape deformation takes place in three stages. In the
                 first stage, the original 2D shape is mapped onto a
                 user definable doubly-curved surface. Next the surface
                 is affinely transformed, once again under the control
                 of the user. In the last stage the transformed 3D shape
                 is projected onto a plane to get the deformed shape. We
                 discuss this deformation technique, and a refinement of
                 this technique, where the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are

  abstract =     "Vinyas is a digital type font design environment for
                 the design of calligraphic style typefaces. It has been
                 designed primarily for creating new fonts rather than
                 enabling the transfer of existing fonts from paper to
                 machine. Within this environment a comprehensive set of
                 interactive tools are available to the type font
                 designer for typeface design. Vinyas is based on a
                 powerful font design methodology, viz, the pen stroke
                 method of specifying shapes. With minimal interaction,
                 the designer can describe his forms, edit them,
                 visualize them singly or in combination, and then
                 create a full dictionary of letterforms for use. Unlike
                 many other systems based on this methodology which
                 produce the final output as bitmaps, Vinyas generates
                 scalable analytic descriptions that are downloadable to
                 a {Postscript${}^{TM}$} laser printer or typesetter.
                 This paper describes the design of the Vinyas system
                 and certain novel aspects of its user interface. The
                 paper also describes the design process and the feature
                 abstraction mechanisms provided to a calligrapher for
                 digital typefont design.",

                 outline fonts for displays and for printing devices,
                 they are still not very common in the east Asian
                 countries where Chinese characters are used. The reason
                 for this is that the complex, structured shapes of
                 Chinese characters take a long time to design and
                 develop. Several systems have proposed automatic
                 generation of outline fonts from the original master
                 fonts. These systems have the serious problem of
                 quality degradation when rasterizing the font at small
                 point sizes, because they do not incorporate a hinting
                 mechanism to adjust the outlines under these
                 circumstances. In this paper, we present an
                 experimental study on a hinting mechanism specially
                 designed for Chinese-style characters. We propose a
                 scheme which automatically generates the hinted outline
                 data from the plain outline fonts. We have implemented
                 and experimented with four sets of Korean Myungjo
                 (Ming) and Gothic style fonts, and have obtained good
                 results with respect to font quality and development

                 network based segmentation error checking and character
                 recognition. In this method the page is segmented, a
                 pre-trained self-organizing classifier is used to
                 classify the characters coming from the segmenter and
                 these reclassified characters are used to adaptively
                 learn the machine print font being segmented. This
                 allows the self organizing character classifier to
                 perform font and image quality checking while
                 independently checking for segmentation errors. No
                 context is used to correct segmentation or recognition
                 errors since the page was randomly generated. In our
                 experiments segmentation errors caused the sequential
                 classification of segmented characters to be confused
                 for 6.6\% of the items segmented because of the
                 splitting and merging of characters. By using

                 segmentation and classification rate of 93.4\% overall.
                 After self-organization correction, segmentation and
                 classification was done to an accuracy of 99.3\% with

                 recognizing Arabic characters. Arabic OCR faces
                 technical problems not encountered in other languages
                 such as cursiveness, overriding and overlapping of
                 characters, multiple shapes per character and the
                 presence of vowels above and below the characters. The
                 proposed approach relies on the fact that the process
                 of connecting Arabic characters to produce cursive
                 writing tends to form a fictitious baseline. During
                 preprocessing, contour analysis provides both component
                 isolation and baseline location. In the feature
                 extraction phase, the words are processed from right to
                 left to generate a sequence of labels. Each label is
                 one of a predetermined codebook that represents all
                 possible bit distribution with respect to the baseline.
                 At a certain position, which depends on the label
                 context, a segmentation decision is taken. During
                 training, a model is generated for each character. This
                 model describes the probability of the occurrence of
                 the labels at each vertical position. During
                 recognition, the probability of the label observation
                 sequence is computed and accumulated. The system has
                 been tested on different typewritten, typeset fonts and

                 both from the traditional point of view and from that
                 of today's digital typography. Then the special case of
                 large characters, such as braces or integral signs, is
                 considered. It is shown that such variable-sized
                 symbols should be computed at print time in order to
                 approach the quality of metal typesetting. Finally, an
                 implementation of such dynamic fonts, still in progress
                 in the Grif editor, is described.",

                 of local typeface homogeneity to improve the accuracy
                 of a character classifier. Given a polyfont classifier
                 which is capable of recognizing any of 100 typefaces
                 moderately well, our method allows it to specialize
                 itself automatically to the single --- but otherwise
                 unknown --- typeface it is reading. Essentially, the
                 classifier retrains itself after examining some of the
                 images, guided at first by the preset classification
                 boundaries of the given classifier, and later by the
                 behavior of the retrained classifier. Experimental
                 trials on 6.4 M pseudo-randomly distorted images show
                 that the method improves on 95 of the 100 typefaces. It
                 reduces the error rate by a factor of 2.5, averaged
                 over 100 typefaces, when applied to an alphabet of 80
                 ASCII characters printed at ten point and digitized at
                 300 pixels\slash inch. This self-correcting method
                 complements, and does not hinder, other methods for
                 improving OCR accuracy, such as linguistic contextual
                 analysis.",

                 structure elements such as horizontal and vertical
                 stems. Stem recognition is based on successive steps
                 such as extraction of straight or nearly straight
                 contour segments, detection of hidden segments, merging
                 of original and hidden segments into larger segments,
                 sorting of segments into classes according to their
                 slopes and, finally, composition of black and white
                 stems. Reference values required for character hinting
                 purposes are obtained by evaluating the regularity of
                 the font through statistical analysis of features such
                 as stem widths and stem angles. Knowledge about the
                 location of stems and analysis of outline parts between
                 stems is used in order to produce automatically

  abstract =     "An important part of many algorithms that convert
                 digital images of machine-printed text into their ASCII
                 equivalent is information about fonts. This paper
                 presents an algorithm for identifying the font in which
                 a document is printed. The algorithm matches word-level
                 information gathered from the document image to fonts
                 in an image database. This method is more robust in the
                 presence of noise than font recognition algorithms that
                 use character-level information. Clusters of frequent
                 function words (such as the, of, and, a, and to) are
                 constructed from an input document image. The clusters
                 are then matched to a database of function words
                 derived from document images, and the document that
                 matches best provides the identification of the input
                 font. This technique utilizes the context from many
                 words in an input document to overcome noise.
                 Experimental results are presented that show
                 near-perfect recognition of fonts, even in noisy

                 on-the-fly, i.e. as a part of the glyph rasterization
                 process. This is done by manipulation of an existing
                 font. So the process described here can be used to give
                 existing fonts the intelligence to join characters
                 correctly when being interpreted by a standard font
                 rasterizer or print server. Of vital importance to the
                 method is the natural appearance of the curve serving
                 as the `ligature backbone'. In this article, a new

  abstract =     "The idea of box connectivity approach (BCA) is to
                 partition the bounding frame of the character bitmap
                 into a fixed number of rectangles, to define some
                 properties of those rectangles, and to establish
                 connectivity relations between the rectangles. Hamming
                 distance and vector optimization are used for
                 classification. Good results in recognition of high
                 quality data (400 dpi) in three fonts (Courier,
                 Helvetica, and New Times Roman) and eight sizes (from 8
                 to 24 points) were reported in a previous paper. These
                 findings are confirmed in this paper by an experiment
                 showing that, for the same number of bits, BCA features
                 increase the rate of recognition twice with respect to
                 features obtained by simple decimation. However, the
                 actual method is limited by the fact that the number of
                 referent templates increases with the number of fonts
                 to be recognized. The purpose of this paper is to
                 remove this limitation. The main part of the paper
                 discusses the properties of the Hamming distance and
                 how they can be used in the BCA algorithm to improve
                 the efficiency of classification. The last section

  abstract =     "This paper reports the performance of several neural
                 network models on the problem of multi-font character
                 recognition. The networks are trained on machine
                 generated, upper-case English letters in selected
                 fonts. The task is to recognize the same letters in
                 different fonts. The results presented here were
                 produced by back-propagation networks, radial basis
                 networks and a new hybrid algorithm which is a
                 combination of the two. These results are compared to
                 those of the Hogg-Hubermann model as well as to those
                 of nearest neighbor and maximum likelihood classifiers.
                 The effects of varying the number of nodes in the
                 hidden layer, the initial conditions, and the number of
                 iterations in a back-propagation network were studied.
                 The experimental results indicate that the number of
                 nodes is an important factor in the recognition rate
                 and that over-training is a significant problem.
                 Different initial conditions also had a measurable
                 effect on performance. The radial basis experiments
                 used different numbers of centers and differing
                 techniques for selecting the means and standard
                 deviations. The best results were obtained with one
                 center per training vector in which the standard
                 deviation for each center was set to the same small
                 number. Finally, a new hybrid technique is discussed in
                 which a radial basis network is used to determine a
                 starting point for a back-propagation network. The
                 back-propagation network refines the radial basis means
                 and standard deviations which are replaced in the
                 radial basis network and used for another iteration.
                 All three networks out-performed the Hogg-Hubermann
                 network as well as the maximum likelihood
                 classifiers.",

  abstract =     "The huge amount of storage needed for document images
                 is a major hindrance to widespread use of document
                 image processing (DIP) systems. Although current DIP
                 systems store document images in a compressed form,
                 there is much room for improvement. In this paper, a
                 nearly-lossless document image compression method is
                 investigated which preserves the relevant information
                 of a document. The proposed approach is based on the
                 segmentation of a document image into different blocks
                 that are classified into one of several block classes
                 and compressed by a block-class-specific data
                 compression method. Whereas image and graphics blocks
                 are compressed using standard image compression
                 methods, text blocks are fed into a text and font
                 recognition module and converted into their textual
                 representation. Finally, text blocks are compressed by
                 encoding their textual representation and enough
                 formatting information to be able to render them as
                 faithfully as possible to the original document.
                 Preliminary results show that (1) the achievable
                 compression ratios compare favorably with standard
                 document image compression methods for all document
                 images tested and (2) the quality of the decompressed
                 image depends on the recognition accuracy of the text
                 recognition module.",

                 process whereby printed documents are transformed into

                 editing, fast retrieval, and other file manipulations
                 through the use of a computer. The recognition stage of
                 an OCR process is made difficult by added noise, image
                 distortion, and the various character typefaces, sizes,
                 and fonts that a document may have. In this study a
                 neural network approach is introduced to perform high
                 accuracy recognition on multi-size and multi-font
                 characters; a novel centroid-dithering training process
                 with a low noise-sensitivity normalization procedure is
                 used to achieve high accuracy results. The study
                 consists of two parts. The first part focuses on single
                 size and single font characters, and a two-layered
                 neural network is trained to recognize the full set of
                 94 ASCII character images in 12-pt Courier font. The
                 second part trades accuracy for additional font and
                 size capability, and a larger two-layered neural
                 network is trained to recognize the full set of 94
                 ASCII character images for all point sizes from 8 to 32
                 and for 12 commonly used fonts. The performance of
                 these two networks is evaluated based on a database of

                 it happens with unconstrained hand-printed characters

                 feature of the method is the use of a special kind of
                 structural description of character shape in connection
                 with a neural network classifier. An original technique
                 is used to achieve the best trade-off between reject
                 and misclassification rates. Experimental results on

                 is to ensure that the displayed version is both legible
                 and aesthetically acceptable. This paper provides an
                 insight about the design methods used to both model and
                 represent the contours of Latin characters and fonts.

  abstract =     "Oriental characters (such as Chinese, Korean, and
                 Japanese characters) are composed of several strokes,
                 and the shape of each stroke is determined by a brush
                 sweep. In the paper, a new representation scheme is
                 proposed for the design of stroke-structured fonts.
                 This approach (called a structured composition of
                 stroke elements) reflects the characteristics of
                 oriental characters; each character is constructed as a
                 set of strokes, and each stroke is represented by
                 primitive features called stroke elements. Since the
                 construction of an exact brush sweep is computationally
                 quite expensive, we suggest a simple approximation
                 method. The outlines of stroke pens are used to
                 represent the starting, ending, and bending of a
                 stroke. The positions of seed pens are interpolated to
                 generate the skeleton curve of a stroke trajectory. The
                 outline of each stroke is generated automatically from
                 the stroke elements. The boundary of each character is
                 constructed by merging these stroke outlines. This
                 approach has various advantages: the font design
                 becomes much simpler, the necessary storage space is
                 greatly reduced, and the font variation becomes much
                 more flexible.",

                 consist of groups of two or more adjacent inoperative
                 display picture elements. Determining the sizes and
                 quantities of cluster defects that can be safely
                 tolerated is a substantial task considering the large
                 number of ways these defects can occur. The magnitude
                 of this task is substantially reduced through the
                 application of an update to a software product called
                 FontTool. The first version of FontTool, an MS DOS

                 constructing Chinese characters. We first highlight the
                 demand for developing an automatic Chinese font design
                 system. Then, we show that the structure of a Chinese
                 character can be represented by a structured character
                 description. The scheme for designing a character is
                 presented in details. Our discussion includes stroke
                 definition, building up components, and balancing the
                 appearance of a character. A number of factors are
                 considered in designing and harmonizing a character
                 which includes component spacing, complexity,
                 blackness, visual centre, centre of gravity, and
                 attractive force. A prototype font design system is
                 being built according to this component-based approach.
                 Samples are given to show how a Chinese character can
                 be constructed using the system. Finally, future
                 research direction is recommended for further

  abstract =     "Printed mathematics has a number of features which
                 distinguish it from conventional text. These include
                 structure in two dimensions (fractions, exponents,
                 limits), frequent font changes, symbols with variable
                 shape (quotient bars), and substantially differing
                 notational conventions from source to source. When
                 compounded with more generic problems such as noise and
                 merged or broken characters, printed mathematics offers
                 a challenging arena for recognition. Our project was
                 initially driven by the goal of scanning and parsing
                 some 5,000 pages of elaborate mathematics (tables of
                 definite integrals). While our prototype system
                 demonstrates success on translating noise-free typeset
                 equations into Lisp expressions appropriate for further
                 processing, a more semantic top-down approach appears
                 necessary for higher levels of performance. Such an
                 approach may benefit the incorporation of these
                 programs into a more general document processing
                 viewpoint. We intend to release to the public our
                 somewhat refined prototypes as utility programs in the
                 hope that they will be of general use in the
                 construction of custom OCR packages. These utilities
                 are quite fast even as originally prototyped in Lisp,
                 where they may be of particular interest to those
                 working on `intelligent' optical processing. Some
                 routines have been re-written in C++ as well.
                 Additional programs providing formula recognition and
                 parsing also form a part of this system. It is
                 important however to realize that distinct conflicting
                 grammars are needed to cover variations in contemporary
                 and historical typesetting, and thus a single simple
                 solution is not possible.",

                 generation is one of the main technologies to provide
                 many fonts to the integrated communication system. We
                 invented an application for Japanese processors which
                 generates 11 fonts out of `pop' font by changing the
                 thickness and shaping the ends of strokes. The size of

                 words (such as the, of, and, a, and to) are also

                 fonts and document images. The font or document that

                 predominant font and function words. This technique
                 takes advantage of the fact that most machine-printed
                 documents are prepared with a single predominant font.
                 Also, the repeated words in the document are utilized
                 to overcome noise in the input. Advantages of this

  abstract =     "The rasterization process of characters from digital
                 outline fonts to bitmaps on displays must include
                 additional information in the form of hints beside the
                 shape of characters in order to produce high quality
                 bitmaps. Hints describe constraints on sizes and shapes
                 inside characters and across the font that should be
                 preserved during rasterization. We describe a novel,
                 fast and fully automatic method for adding those hints
                 to characters. The method is based on identifying
                 hinting situations inside characters. It includes
                 gathering global font information and linking it to
                 characters, defining a set of constraints, sorting
                 them, and converting them to hints in any known hinting
                 technology (PostScript, TrueType or other). Our scheme
                 is general enough to be applied on any language and on
                 complex scripts such as Chinese Japanese and Korean.
                 Although still inferior to expert manual hinting, our
                 method produces high quality bitmaps which approach
                 this goal. The method can also be used as a solid base
                 for further hinting refinements done manually.",

                 fonts and the lives of the great typographers,
                 revealing the extent to which fonts are not only shaped
                 by but also define the world in which we live. Fonts
                 surround us every day, on street signs and buildings,
                 on movie posters and books, and on just about every
                 product that we buy. But where do fonts come from and
                 why do we need so many? Who is behind the businesslike
                 subtlety of Times New Roman, the cool detachment of
                 Arial, or the maddening lightness of Comic Sans (and
                 the movement to ban it)? Simon Garfield embarks on a
                 mission to answer these questions and more, and reveal
                 what may be the very best and worst fonts in the world.
                 Type faces are now 560 years old, but we barely knew
                 their names until about twenty years ago, when the
                 pull-down font menus on our first computers made us all
                 the gods of type. Beginning in the early days of
                 Gutenberg and ending with the most adventurous digital
                 fonts, Garfield unravels our age old obsession with the
                 way our words look. This book investigates a range of
                 modern mysteries, including how Helvetica took over the
                 world, what inspires the seemingly ubiquitous use of
                 Trajan on bad movie posters, and what makes a font look
                 presidential, male or female, American, British,
                 German, or Jewish. From the typeface of Beatlemania to
                 the graphic vision of the Obama campaign, fonts can
                 signal a musical revolution or the rise of an American
                 president. This book is a must-read for the design
                 conscious that will forever change the way you look at
                 the printed word.",

  abstract =     "This is the first English-language biography of the
                 relentlessly ambitious and incomparably talented
                 printer Giambattista Bodoni (1740--1813). Born to a
                 printing family in the small foothill town of Saluzzo,
                 he left his comfortable life to travel to Rome in 1758
                 where he served as an apprentice of Cardinal Spinelli
                 at the Propaganda Fide press. There, under the
                 sponsorship of Abb{\'e} Ruggieri, his close friend,
                 mentor, and protector, he learned all aspects of the
                 printing craft. Even then, his real talent, indeed his
                 genius, lay in type design and punchcutting, especially
                 of the exotic foreign alphabets needed by the papal
                 office to spread the faith. His life changed when in
                 1768 at age 28 he was invited by the young Duke of
                 Parma to abandon Rome for that very French city to
                 establish and direct the ducal press. He remained in
                 Parma, overseeing a vast variety of printing, some of
                 the pedestrian, but much of it glorious. And all of it
                 making use of the typefaces he personally designed and
                 engraved. This fine book goes beyond Bodoni's capacity
                 as a printer; it examines the life and times in which
                 he lived, the turbulent and always fragile political
                 climate, the fascinating cast of characters that
                 enlivened the ducal court, the impressive list of
                 visitors making the pilgrimage to Parma, and the unique
                 position Parma occupied, politically Italian but very
                 much French in terms of taste and culture. Even the
                 food gets its due (and in savory detail). The
                 illustrations --- of the city, of the press, of the
                 types and matrices --- are compelling enough, but most
                 striking are the pages from the books he designed. And
                 especially, pages from his typographic masterpiece, the
                 Manuale Tipografico, painstakingly prepared by his wife
                 Ghitta, posthumously published in two volumes, and
                 displaying the myriad typefaces in multiple sizes that
                 Bodini had designed and engraved over a long and
                 prolific career. Intriguing, scholarly, visually
                 arresting, and designed and printing to Bodoni's
                 standards, this title belongs on the shelf of any
                 self-respecting bibliophile. It not only makes for
                 compelling reading, it will be considered the biography
                 of record of a great printer for years to come.",

                 neurological disability that impairs a person's ability
                 to read and write. There is evidence that the
                 presentation of the text has a significant effect on a
                 text's accessibility for people with dyslexia. However,
                 to the best of our knowledge, there are no experiments
                 that objectively measure the impact of the typeface
                 (font) on screen reading performance. In this article,
                 we present the first experiment that uses eye-tracking
                 to measure the effect of typeface on reading speed.
                 Using a mixed between-within subject design, 97
                 subjects (48 with dyslexia) read 12 texts with 12
                 different fonts. Font types have an impact on
                 readability for people with and without dyslexia. For
                 the tested fonts, sans serif, monospaced, and roman
                 font styles significantly improved the reading
                 performance over serif, proportional, and italic fonts.
                 On the basis of our results, we recommend a set of more
                 accessible fonts for people with and without

  abstract =     "This study is a fascinating inside look at digital
                 type design, the rather mysterious career of one of its
                 most important practitioners, and the history and
                 culture of Adobe Type, with additional insight into
                 other type designers of the digital era. It is
                 difficult to imagine a graphic designer in the last
                 quarter century who is not familiar with at least some
                 of Carol Twombly's typefaces. Yet many of those who use
                 her fonts today would be hard pressed to name their
                 designer. Twombly studied at the Rhode Island School of
                 Design under professor Charles Bigelow, and she also
                 studied at the Bigelow and Holmes studio. She joined
                 Adobe Systems in 1988, when the company was hiring
                 young designers for the newly launched type department.
                 During her ten years at Adobe, she designed some of the
                 most recognizable and popular typefaces on the market
                 today, including Trajan (1989), Charlemagne (1989),
                 Lithos (1989), Adobe Caslon (1990), Myriad (1991, with
                 Robert Slimbach), Viva (1993), Nueva (1994), and
                 Chaparral (1997). In 1994, Twombly won the Prix Charles
                 Peignot, given by the Association Typographique
                 Internationale (ATypI) the first woman, and second
                 American, to receive the award. Having achieved
                 international recognition, Twombly was uncomfortable
                 being in the public eye at conferences and in Adobe
                 marketing materials. She also grew dissatisfied with
                 changes at Adobe and with her evolving role at the
                 company. In 1999 she left both Adobe and her career to
                 pursue other artistic interests. Nancy Stock-Allen is a
                 graphic designer and a blogger on subjects related to
                 design, type, and women in design history. She was
                 formerly Professor of Graphic Design and department
                 chair at the Moore College of Art and Design. She
                 interviewed and corresponded extensively with Carol
                 Twombly and many of her associates and colleagues in
                 writing this profile of a woman who rose to the top of
                 a field historically dominated by men, at a time of

                 Futura is one of the most used fonts in the world today
                 the typeface of modern design --- more so even than
                 Helvetica. This fascinating book explores the cultural
                 history and uses of a face that's so common you might
                 not notice, until you start looking, and then you can't
                 escape it. Douglas Thomas traces Futura from its
                 Bauhaus-inspired origin in Paul Renner's 1924 design,
                 to its current role as the go-to choice for corporate
                 work, logos, motion pictures, and advertisements.
                 \booktitle{Never Use Futura} is illuminating, sometimes
                 playful, reading, not just for type nerds, but for
                 anyone interested in how typefaces are used, take on
                 meaning, and become a language of their own. Conceived
                 around the directive commonly given to students,
                 \booktitle{Never Use Futura} is the first major
                 English-language book to concentrate on Futura, using
                 the foundational typeface to open up an alternate

                 type designer Gerard Unger is the first comprehensive

                 concise chapters, each clearly describing a different
                 aspect of type design, from the influence of language
                 to today's digital developments, from how our eyes and
                 brain process letterforms to their power of expression.
                 This splendid book includes more than 200 illustrations
                 and practical examples that illuminate the theoretical
                 material. The terminology is succinctly explained in
                 the volume's extensive glossary. The theory is
                 internationally orientated and relevant for typography

                 the papers presented during the third Raster Imaging
                 and Digital Typography conference, held at Darmstadt,
                 Germany, from 11 to 13 April 1994. Earlier conferences
                 in the series took place in 1989 at Lausanne,
                 Switzerland (organized by Roger D. Hersch, EPFL) and in
                 1991 at Boston, Massachussets (organized by Robert A.
                 Morris, University of Massachussets at Boston). The
                 corresponding proceedings are published by Cambridge
                 University Press (see below). Digital typography is a
                 relatively new field: the first commercial
                 cathode-ray-tube photo\-composing machine appeared in
                 1966. Since that time, the field has been growing very
                 fast, and is still active. During the RIDT'89
                 conference, emphasis was laid on the rasterisation of
                 outline characters and on rendering techniques. RIDT'91
                 concentrated more on digital halftoning and on
                 greyscale characters. However, both of these
                 conferences bore in mind that beyond the mathematics of
                 shapes and their rendering, printing types exist with
                 their own aesthetic rules. That is why the
                 presentations were made by a mix of technologists,
                 scientists and designers. The RIDT'94 programme
                 committee tried to attract a similar mix of papers when
                 this conference was launched. As expected, the fields
                 have moved on since the last conference, but we hope
                 that the selected papers adequately exhibit the present
                 state of the art in raster imaging and digital
                 typography. In the recent past, formal research in
                 digital typography has dealt with graphical algorithms,
                 such as the rendering of outline characters and the
                 generation of outline characters from bit-mapped
                 drawings, to name but two. Present research focuses on
                 models and methods for concise but precise font
                 description and modelling. That trend began in industry
                 with font interpolation programs and font systems such
                 as Adobe Systems' Multiple Master technology. This
                 research definitively belongs to computer science, with
                 keywords such as {\em object orientation}, {\em regular
                 expressions}, {\em string matching\/} and {\em shape
                 parameterization}. A look at related fields, such as
                 computer-aided design, shows that there still remains
                 plenty of mathematical research to be done in digital
                 typography. Mathematics is already used in CAD to
                 express aesthetic criteria, both at the local
                 (individual curves/surfaces) and the global level, for
                 ensuring overall appearance and design consistency.
