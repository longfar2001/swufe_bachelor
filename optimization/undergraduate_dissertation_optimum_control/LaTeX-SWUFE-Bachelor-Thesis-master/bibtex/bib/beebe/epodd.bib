                 publishing and computer science has already been
                 touched on in the editorial section of this issue.
                 Further connections between the two fields are
                 highlighted in this brief paper and it is suggested
                 that electronic publishing differs from other computer
                 application areas because it benefits not only from the
                 brute-force application of cheap computer power but
                 also from the direct application of a host of computer
                 science concepts. The history of computers and
                 typesetters is examined leading up to the electronic
                 publishing era, followed by an appraisal of those
                 computer science topics which have already been applied
                 to problems in typesetting and publishing, and those
                 which seem poised for exploitation and application in
                 the near future. The importance of abstract notions and
                 high-level ideas in the development of computer
                 science---and hence in electronic publishing---is
                 pointed out.",

                 and printing the index for a book or a manual. The
                 input consists of lines containing index terms and page
                 numbers. The programs collect multiple occurrences of
                 the same terms, compress runs of page numbers, create
                 permutations (e.g., `index, book' from `book index'),
                 and sort them into proper alphabetic order. The
                 programs can cope with embedded formatting commands
                 (size and font changes, etc.), with roman numeral page
                 numbers, and with {\bf see} terms. The programs do not
                 help with the original creation of index terms. The
                 implementation runs on the UNIX\registered{} operating
                 system. It uses a long pipeline of short {\bf awk}
                 programs rather than a single program in a conventional
                 language. This structure makes the programs easy to
                 adapt or augment to meet special requirements that
                 arise in different indexing styles. The programs were
                 intended to be used with {\bf troff}, but can be used
                 with a formatter like {\TeX} with minor changes. An
                 appendix contains a complete listing of the programs,
                 which total about 200 lines.",

                 systems that are oriented to an author's preparation of
                 printed material must permit the flexible
                 specification, modification, and reuse of the contents
                 of the document. Interactive document preparation
                 systems commonly have incorporated simple
                 representations---an unconstrained linear list of
                 document objects in the `What You See Is What You Get'
                 (\WYSIWYG) systems. Recent research projects have been
                 directed at the interactive manipulation of richer
                 tree-oriented representations in which object
                 relationships are constrained through grammatical
                 specification. The advantage of such representations is
                 the increased flexibility that they provide in the
                 reusability of the document and its components and the
                 more powerful user commands that they permit. We report
                 on the experience gained from the design of two such
                 systems. Although the two systems were designed
                 independently of each other, a common set of issues,
                 representations, and techniques has been identified. An
                 important component of these projects has been to
                 examine the {\WYSIWYG} user interface, retaining the
                 naturalness of their user interface but eliminating
                 their dependencies on the physical-page representation.
                 Aspects of the design of such systems remain open for
                 further research. We describe these open research
                 problems and indicate some of the further gains that
                 may be achievable through investigation of these
                 document representations.",

                 `electronic publishing' would perhaps be better called
                 `electronic printing' or `electronic typography' or
                 `electronic drawing' or `electronic file cabinets'. The
                 word `publishing' has traditionally meant `to make
                 generally known' or `to disseminate'. In December 1985
                 I began a venture in true electronic
                 publishing\emdash{}`true' in the sense that its primary
                 goals were to explore electronic dissemination rather
                 than electronic typesetting or formatting. I wanted to
                 start a periodical that could be distributed
                 electronically, that would use computers for every
                 aspect of its production and distribution process, and
                 that would be on a topic of wide enough interest to
                 attract subscribers in as many countries as possible.
                 Furthermore the topic had to be absorbing enough to
                 engage my own interest for long enough to gain
                 substantial experience. The chosen topic was cookery. I
                 began a weekly magazine whose contents are recipes. To
                 submit a recipe for publication, a prospective author
                 mails the recipe to the editor by electronic mail. The
                 publishing process from that point is similar to more
                 ordinary magazines. A copy editor rewrites the recipe
                 for stylistic consistency and then hands it to the
                 `international desk', which checks to make sure that
                 the recipe uses only ingredients that are widely known
                 and internationally available. The international desk
                 also converts recipes to or from metric units, so that
                 every recipe will include both. From the international
                 desk, the recipe goes to a `test and proofreading'
                 office, at which an editor checks to make sure that the
                 recipe is coherent and comprehensible and that the dish
                 it describes is palatable. Finally, recipes are moved
                 to the production office, where they are bundled into
                 issues in time to meet a Thursday publication deadline.
                 During this test period I have done all of the
                 editorial tasks myself, but the internal structure of
                 the publication system is such that different people
                 could do the different tasks without disrupting the
                 flows and procedures. The recipes are distributed in a
                 text formatting language, and each subscriber is sent
                 software to format that language into some output
                 format that he can print on his machine. Subscribers
                 typically extract the recipes out of each weekly issue
                 and put them into a local database, from which they can
                 print pages for a notebook or access the recipes with
                 online retrieval commands. The text formatting language
                 is a dialect of {\em troff}, and the vast majority of
                 subscribers use a special set of {\em troff\/} macros
                 to do the formatting. The publication is called {\em
                 The USENET Cookbook}. It has about 13~000 subscribers
                 worldwide, and has had recipes contributed by about 300
                 different people. Most of the subscribers are in
                 English-speaking countries.",

  abstract =     "The manipulation of text and graphics within a
                 computer provides opportunities for the exploitation of
                 parallel processing. It is straightforward to identify
                 blocks of material such as complete diagrams or
                 paragraphs of text which can be processed in parallel
                 and which have modest requirements for synchronization
                 and communication between the blocks. The features of a
                 problem which lead to an elegant and efficient
                 application of parallelism are identified, including
                 good locality of reference, a small `state vector' of
                 shared global variables and a clear relationship
                 between the material on the page and the `cost' of
                 processing it. This last-named attribute enables a
                 problem to be partitioned among multiple processors by
                 a static compile-time analysis rather than relying on
                 costly run-time allocation strategies. The {\PIC}
                 program for line diagrams has been modified to allow
                 for such a static allocation and to permit
                 synchronization and rendezvous between multiple
                 invocations of the program. The aim of this was to
                 investigate whether worthwhile gains in performance
                 would result from subdividing a diagram drawn with
                 {\PIC} and then processing the various portions in
                 parallel. A series of benchmark timings is presented
                 which show the degree of overlap obtainable in
                 processing separate parts of a diagram together with
                 the inherent limits to parallelism imposed by the
                 `atomic' entities in {\PIC} and the inevitable
                 communication overheads between the parallel processes.
                 The design features of the {\PIC} language are
                 identified which made it suitable for these researches
                 and we are able to draw certain general conclusions
                 about desirable properties of text and graphic entities
                 which are to be processed in parallel. This in turn
                 enables us to identify design features of the
                 underlying software which will facilitate parallel

                 consisting of text written in languages printed in
                 three different directions, left-to-right,
                 right-to-left, and top-to-bottom. For example, this
                 paper is such a document because it contains text
                 written in English, Hebrew, Japanese, and Chinese. The
                 system assumes that the input is in the order in which
                 the text is read aloud, and it produces output in which
                 each language is printed in its own correct direction,
                 but for which a human cognizant of the reading
                 conventions will reproduce the input order. The system
                 consists of three major pieces of software: Ossana and
                 Kernighan's {\tt ditroff} for formatting text
                 consisting of only left-to-right or unidirectional
                 text, Buchman and Berry's {\tt ffortid} for rearranging
                 right-to-left language text occurring in {\tt ditroff}
                 output to be printed from right to left, and a new
                 program {\tt bditroff} for rearranging top-to-bottom
                 text occurring in {\tt ditroff} output to be printed
                 from top to bottom. Below are translations of this
                 English language abstract, except for this paragraph,
                 into Hebrew, Japanese, and Chinese. The latter two are
                 printed twice, once in a modern left-to-right style,
                 and once in a more traditional top-to-bottom style. The

                 structures. These may arise, at one level, because of
                 the material comprising the text -- thus textbooks will
                 be organized differently from research papers -- and at
                 a lower level as a result of the layout conventions by
                 which the text is formatted. These structuring regimes
                 may be seen as defining a set of constraints which a
                 document within a specific class must satisfy. In this
                 paper we examine the model recently proposed in
                 Reference \cite{Koo} which is used for representing and
                 modifying electronic documents. This employs simple
                 graph grammars as a means of translating changes in the
                 document structure into modifications to the computer
                 representation. The aim of this approach is to provide
                 computer support which will allow the appropriate
                 structural conventions to be preserved while the
                 document is being edited. We consider the following
                 problem with this method: given a set of `constraints'
                 which the document must satisfy and a collection of
                 rules prescribing how the document representation may
                 be modified, how does one prove that {\em only\/}
                 documents which obey the constraints can be generated
                 by repeated applications of the rules? We describe one
                 way in which this question can be more precisely
                 formulated and call this the {\em consistency
                 checking\/} problem. It is shown that, in general, this
                 problem cannot be solved. We then outline how, for
                 practical applications, the consistency checking
                 problem may be solved for certain special cases.",

                 concerns a document processing model accounting for
                 aspects of an activity which is usually called
                 formatting. The core of the model, an experimental
                 formatting language called FFL, is the central topic.
                 FFL is a purely functional language in the style of FP
                 and the applicative part of APL\@. Sequences,
                 characters, and so-called boxes constitute the data
                 types and among the build-in primitives are functions
                 for aligning/spacing, breaking etc. Emphasis is put on
                 presenting the language and exemplifying its use. Also
                 considered are issues in type checking of formatting
                 function definitions and techniques for doing
                 incremental formatting with FFL formatting functions.
                 FFL is currently being implemented by the {\Benedick}
                 project group led by the author.",

  abstract =     "The IGD (Interactive Graphical Documents) hypermedia
                 system was designed to make possible interactive
                 presentations that can be explored by and customized
                 for individual users. We describe IGD's authoring
                 facilities through an annotated excerpt from an editing
                 session, emphasizing how the system's document model
                 and user interface help support the creation of large
                 documents. Although we feel that IGD successfully
                 addressed some of the issues of scale, experience with
                 the system has convinced us that it is wrong to cast
                 many of the problems of authoring large hypertexts as
                 ones that can be solved by implementing editors of
                 sufficient scope and sophistication. We believe that
                 hypertext design systems based on direct editing of
                 documents inherit many of the bottlenecks associated
                 with the conventional document authoring process. These
                 problems are compounded by the added intellectual
                 burden of designing a connective structure of keyworded
                 links. We contrast the reality of the author-centered,
                 editor-based approach to document design and layout,
                 exemplified by IGD, with the promise of a
                 knowledge-based, automated alternative, and discuss why
                 we feel that many of the facilities provided by IGD
                 will still be useful even if presentations can be
                 created entirely automatically.",

                 notifications of edits to a document to trigger

                 queries, which are evaluated and placed in the document

                 portions of a document, which are maintained as the

                 types of thesaurus display: graphic, alphabetical, and
                 hierarchical. Graphic displays generated by hypertext
                 browsers appear to be inferior to their printed
                 counterparts. The simple alphabetical display can be
                 easily mapped onto hypertext systems but has the
                 inherent disadvantage of not showing a full hierarchy

                 hypertext models and systems. The meta-structure was
                 initially developed to help us understand the
                 architecture of a specific hypertext model (the Trellis
                 hypertext model). However, its organization seems
                 generally applicable to a wide range of other models
                 and systems as well. As such, the meta-structure is a
                 good candidate for a high-level hypertext {\it

                 Trellis hypertext reference model}, or the {\it

                 each node in a hypertext database was presented with

                 by counting the number of users who had previously

                 the popularity information was not provided. One
                 possible use of popularity can be to offset the

                 items near the top or bottom of a linear list. We

  abstract =     "SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is an ISO
                 Standard that specifies a language for document
                 representation. The main idea behind SGML is to
                 strictly separate the structure and contents of a
                 document from the processing of that document. This
                 results in application-independent and thus reusable
                 documents. To gain the full benefit of this approach,
                 tools are needed to support a wide range of
                 applications. The Standard itself does not define how
                 to specify the processing of documents. Many existing
                 SGML systems allow for a simple translation of an SGML
                 document, which exhibits a 1--1 correspondence between
                 elements in the SGML document and its translation. For
                 many applications this does not suffice. In other
                 systems the processing can be expressed in a
                 special-purpose programming language. In this paper the
                 various approaches to processing SGML documents are
                 assessed. We also discuss a novel approach, taken in
                 the Amsterdam SGML Parser. In this approach, processing
                 actions are embedded in the grammar rules that specify
                 the document structure, much like processing actions
                 are embedded in grammars of programming languages that
                 are input to a parser generator. The appendix contains
                 an extended example of the use of this approach.",

                 There are three different methods available for getting

                 auto-tracing and direct design on a workstation screen.
                 The advent of intelligent font scaling requires us to
                 ensure the `optical' quality of a font and also the
                 `numerical' quality of its data; this, in turn, means
                 that new procedures have to be added to the font
                 production process. Furthermore, a given typeface has
                 to be rendered on a wide variety of output devices
                 ranging from computer displays, printers (dot-matrix,
                 laser, inkjet or thermal-transfer) and typesetters (CRT

                 level can be examined in parallel to determine whether
                 they are, in fact, a good match for the query. The
                 results demonstrate that communication is the critical
                 factor in all of the transputer networks that were
                 investigated. A high degree of speed-up can be obtained
                 when only the pattern-matching search is carried out.
                 When text signatures are used, however, the speed-up is
                 less, decreasing in line with an increase in the size
                 of the text signatures that are used.",

                 electronic publishing is addressed by raising two
                 issues relating to the content and structure of an
                 electronic publishing course. The first is whether it
                 is possible to agree upon a generic curriculum, based
                 on a set of headings or topics, which may be treated
                 quite differently by those in different disciplines
                 (e.g., typographers, computer scientists). The second
                 related issue is whether it is appropriate to set down
                 a single structure which puts topics under specific
                 headings, given the interdisciplinary nature of the
                 subject. A course on the theory of electronic
                 publishing given to typography students is used as an
                 example of the type of material that might be covered
                 and how it may be structured. A HyperCard has been
                 developed alongside part of this course. The way in
                 which this subject fits in with the course in
                 Typography \& Graphic Communication as a whole is
                 briefly described. It is proposed that hypertext
                 systems go some way towards providing students with
                 alternative structures for organizing their knowledge
                 of electronic publishing. This platform could therefore

                 main goal of {\bf ALIVE} is to enable the user of a
                 technical publishing system to establish live-links
                 with data stored on remote databases. Live-links allow
                 for automatic update of a document with database
                 contents: whenever a modification occurs in the
                 database data referenced from the document text, the
                 document is updated accordingly. The {\bf ALIVE} user
                 interface has been implemented by exploiting the
                 functionality offered by the Interleaf\registered{}
                 technical publishing environment, providing the user
                 with a fully integrated environment. It allows the user

                 databases and to formulate queries related to data
                 stored in them by means of a menu-based interface. By
                 enriching technical publishing features with data

                 is able for format multilingual scientific documents,
                 containing text in Arabic or Persian, as well as other
                 languages, plus pictures, graphs, formulae, tables,
                 bibliographical citations, and bibliographies. The
                 system is an extension of {\tt ditroff/ffortid} that is
                 already capable of handling Hebrew in the context of
                 multilingual scientific documents. {\tt
                 ditroff/ffortid} itself is a collection of pre- and
                 postprocessors for the UNIX {\tt ditroff} (Device
                 Independent Typesetter RunOFF) formatter. The new
                 system is built without changing {\tt ditroff} itself.
                 The extension consists of a new preprocessor, fonts,
                 and a modified existing postprocessor. The preprocessor
                 transliterates from a phonetic rendition of Arabic
                 using only the two cases of the Latin alphabet. The
                 preprocessor assigns a position, stand-alone,
                 connected-previous, connected-after, or connected-both,
                 to each letter. It recognizes ligatures and assigns
                 vertical positions from a standard Arabic keyboard
                 using the standard ASMO encoding. In any case, the
                 output has each positioned letter or ligature and each
                 diacritical mark encoded according to the font's
                 encoding scheme. The fonts are assumed to be designed
                 to connect letters that should be connected when they
                 are printed adjacent to each other. The postprocessor
                 is an enhancement of the {\tt ffortid} program that
                 arranges for right-to-left printing of identified
                 right-to-left fonts. The major enhancement is
                 stretching final letters of lines or words instead of
                 inserting extra inter-word spaces, in order to justify
                 the text. As a self-test, this paper was formatted
                 using the described system, and it contains many
                 examples of text written in Arabic, Hebrew, and

                 means of communication, starting with hand-set metal
                 type and mechanical typesetting in hot metal.
                 Present-day techniques of phototypesetting, and of
                 digital typesetting, via cathode-ray tube and laser
                 machines, are also discussed. Careful attention is paid
                 to the cultural impact of these techniques, with
                 particular reference to traditional French typefaces
                 which often have small x-height and very thin hairlines
                 (which can disappear at small point sizes). Reference
                 is also made to the impact of each of these modern
                 typesetting methods on both `informational' and
                 `cultural' texts. A strong argument is presented that a
                 nation's typefaces encapsulate its national spirit and
                 its culture. For this reason, it is regrettable that
                 the advent of laser-driven imaging devices has brought
                 with it an `anglicization' of many fonts, via an
                 increase in x-height, and a reluctance to countenance a
                 non-linear variation of letterforms and set-width with
                 point size \emdash{} a characteristic so crucial to the
                 readability of classic texts. A plea is made for the
                 rapidly developing computer technology to be deployed
                 in the interests of {\em quality\/} as well as {\em
                 quantity}. Modern techniques have all the advantages of
                 photographic sharpness but this must be harnessed to
                 the traditional subtleties of the original typeface
                 design if the intentions, and the cultural identity, of
                 the typeface designer are to be truly respected.",

                 including text, graphics, animations, and digitized
                 sound and images. Effective database support for
                 hypermedia-based computing environments is essential.
                 In order to be effective, this support must provide a
                 variety of capabilities that are not offered by the
                 current generation of database management systems. We
                 report on a prototypic system called HB1 that has been
                 designed to meet the storage needs of advanced
                 hypermedia system architectures. HB1 is referred to as
                 a hyperbase management system (HBMS) because it stores
                 and manipulates information and the connectivity data
                 that link information together to form hypermedia. HB1
                 is composed of three subsystems: the Object Manager
                 (OM), Association Set Manager (ASM), and Storage
                 Manager (SM). OM and ASM are both server processes
                 accessible to distributed client processes via IPC
                 interfaces. OM is an object server. ASM manages
                 structural data applicable to the objects within OM's
                 repository that are involved in hypermedia connections.
                 Physical storage is managed by SM which, in this
                 implementation, is a semantic network database
                 management system. HB1 instantiates a conceptual model
                 of hypermedia that is distinctly computational, has a
                 strong notion of anchor and link, and abstracts
                 information, behavior, and structure from hypermedia.
                 It has been used as a back-end for an open,
                 object-based hypermedia system that implements
                 distributed, inter-application linking. HB1 is proving

  abstract =     "In spite of a worldwide trend towards the use of
                 outline fonts for displays and for printing devices,
                 they are still not very common in the east Asian
                 countries where Chinese characters are used. The reason
                 for this is that the complex, structured shapes of
                 Chinese characters take a long time to design and
                 develop. Several systems have proposed automatic
                 generation of outline fonts from the original master
                 fonts. These systems have the serious problem of
                 quality degradation when rasterizing the font at small
                 point sizes, because they do not incorporate a hinting
                 mechanism to adjust the outlines under these
                 circumstances. In this paper, we present an
                 experimental study on a hinting mechanism specially
                 designed for Chinese-style characters. We propose a
                 scheme which automatically generates the hinted outline
                 data from the plain outline fonts. We have implemented
                 and experimented with four sets of Korean Myungjo
                 (Ming) and Gothic style fonts, and have obtained good
                 results with respect to font quality and development

                 hyperdocument. Canto uses two types of nodes: concept
                 nodes, which provide organizational structure, and
                 information nodes, which contain text and other data.
                 The operations provided by the Canto Data Model are
                 defined formally using the Z specification language.
                 The Canto Schema Language gives the hypertext designer

                 and Digital Typography conference, held at Darmstadt,
                 Germany, from 11 to 13 April 1994. Earlier conferences
                 in the series took place in 1989 at Lausanne,
                 Switzerland (organized by Roger D. Hersch, EPFL) and in
                 1991 at Boston, Massachussets (organized by Robert A.
                 Morris, University of Massachussets at Boston). The
                 corresponding proceedings are published by Cambridge
                 University Press (see below). Digital typography is a
                 relatively new field: the first commercial
                 cathode-ray-tube photo\-composing machine appeared in
                 1966. Since that time, the field has been growing very
                 fast, and is still active. During the RIDT'89
                 conference, emphasis was laid on the rasterisation of
                 outline characters and on rendering techniques. RIDT'91
                 concentrated more on digital halftoning and on
                 greyscale characters. However, both of these
                 conferences bore in mind that beyond the mathematics of
                 shapes and their rendering, printing types exist with
                 their own aesthetic rules. That is why the
                 presentations were made by a mix of technologists,
                 scientists and designers. The RIDT'94 programme
                 committee tried to attract a similar mix of papers when
                 this conference was launched. As expected, the fields
                 have moved on since the last conference, but we hope
                 that the selected papers adequately exhibit the present
                 state of the art in raster imaging and digital
                 typography. In the recent past, formal research in
                 digital typography has dealt with graphical algorithms,
                 such as the rendering of outline characters and the
                 generation of outline characters from bit-mapped
                 drawings, to name but two. Present research focuses on
                 models and methods for concise but precise font
                 description and modelling. That trend began in industry
                 with font interpolation programs and font systems such
                 as Adobe Systems' Multiple Master technology. This
                 research definitively belongs to computer science, with
                 keywords such as {\em object orientation}, {\em regular
                 expressions}, {\em string matching\/} and {\em shape
                 parameterization}. A look at related fields, such as
                 computer-aided design, shows that there still remains
                 plenty of mathematical research to be done in digital
                 typography. Mathematics is already used in CAD to
                 express aesthetic criteria, both at the local
                 (individual curves/surfaces) and the global level, for
                 ensuring overall appearance and design consistency.

                 implemented in two stages: rule-based modifications,
                 followed by individual pixel editing. The effectiveness

                 reading material than typefaces without serifs. Authors
                 contend that readers prefer roman above sans serif,
                 that it is read faster, and that the comprehension rate
                 is possibly higher when text is set in a roman
                 typeface. The absence of satisfactory empirical data to
                 prove these assumptions, and the importance of
                 legibility in academic reading material, motivated this
                 study. The aim of the study was to determine the
                 comparative legibility of sans serif and roman
                 typefaces. Four hundred and fifty primary school
                 subjects from nine different schools were used in a
                 control group pre-test, post-test research design where
                 four different experiments were completed. Romans and
                 sans serifs were found to be equally legible, as no
                 significant statistical difference was found between
                 the reading speed, scanning speed, accuracy and
                 comprehension at the 0.05 level. These results are in
                 contrast to the assumption that romans are more legible
                 than sans serifs. They can be interpreted as promising
                 for graphic designers and typographers, as it appears
                 that legibility will not necessarily be sacrificed when

                 existing documents, where reuse involves finding the
                 relevant material, modifying it as needed, and
                 stitching the pieces together. The objective of this
                 paper is to demonstrate how a focus on reuse can shed
                 light on current efforts to build structured document
                 systems and to design and use standards, such as SGML,

                 which represents a document as a network of information
                 fragments freely referencing one another, helps users
                 create ideas; and structured document models, which
                 represent a document as a rigid tree structure of
                 document components, help users organize documents and
                 make layouts. Our document model comprises the
                 underlying structure and the surface: the underlying
                 structure is a network structure; and the surface is an
                 interface providing a view of the underlying structure.
                 The key features of our document model are: (1) the
                 surface defines tree structures as marked parts of the
                 underlying structure, and maintains consistency between
                 the network and tree structures; (2) the surface
                 monitors users' walks in the underlying network and
                 marks the trails to define tree structures; and (3) the
                 defined tree structures work as structured documents.

                 are used for parsing, which achieves a linear

                 should ideally preserve, in a unified document

                 document while maintaining enough of its underlying
                 structure to enable searching and other forms of
                 semantic processing. Until recently it has been hard to
                 find a document representation which combined these

                 change as technology itself changes. Placing marks on
                 paper (by whatever means), and distributing the result,
                 are perhaps the first thoughts that the word evokes but
                 nowadays it encompasses an ever-widening range of
                 preparation, presentation and dissemination methods.
                 Video sources, animation, still images and sound
                 samples are now available as methods of imparting
                 knowledge---and all of these are increasingly reliant
                 on technology-dependent delivery systems. The end-user
                 of information contained in such electronic
                 publications has expectations of the delivery and
                 display mechanisms which have been shaped, in the main,
                 by exposure to the broadcast media, whose centrally
                 funded resources are capable of exploiting
                 high-technology solutions. In trying to emulate similar
                 delivery systems at a personal level, the electronic
                 publisher needs to have a general awareness of what
                 present-day technologies can achieve, together with an
                 appreciation of cost and practical issues. This paper
                 gives a brief survey of these newer technologies as
                 seen from today's perspective.",

                 on-the-fly, i.e. as a part of the glyph rasterization

                 rasterizer or print server. Of vital importance to the

                 purposes are obtained by evaluating the regularity of
                 the font through statistical analysis of features such
