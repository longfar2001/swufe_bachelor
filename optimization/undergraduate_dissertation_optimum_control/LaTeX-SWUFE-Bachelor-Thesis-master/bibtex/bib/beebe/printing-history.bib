%%%                        This bibliography also includes BibTeX
%%%                        entries for most of roughly 200 books
%%%                        reviewed in the journal, when they could be

%%%                        Data for this bibliography have been
%%%                        collected primarily from the publisher Web
%%%                        site, with additions from the BibNet Project
%%%                        and TeX User Group bibliography archives.
%%%
%%%                        The metadata at the publisher Web site are
%%%                        poor, with some volumes missing years, no
%%%                        page numbers, and sometimes no clear
%%%                        distinction between authors and titles.
%%%                        Where possible, citations to the journal
%%%                        articles with missing years have been
%%%                        located, and the year omissions corrected.
%%%                        Thus, at least a few of the BibTeX entries in
%%%                        this file may contain errors.  Sadly, many of
%%%                        the journal issues are out of print, and
%%%                        there do not appear to be any online archives
%%%                        of the journal articles.

%%%                        Numerous errors in the Web sources noted
%%%                        above have been corrected.  Spelling has been
%%%                        verified with the UNIX spell and GNU ispell
%%%                        programs using the exception dictionary

%%%                        BibTeX citation tags are uniformly chosen
%%%                        as name:year:abbrev, where name is the
%%%                        family name of the first author or editor,
%%%                        year is a 4-digit number, and abbrev is a
%%%                        3-letter condensation of important title
%%%                        words. Citation tags were automatically

                 activities, place, and influence of American printers
                 and journalists during the period of our Revolution is
                 the American Antiquarian Society's primary scholarly
                 contribution to the two hundredth anniversary of that
                 pivotal process. Since its founding in 1812 by Isaiah
                 Thomas, one of the leading journalists of the
                 Revolutionary era, the American Antiquarian Society has
                 expended a very large portion of its energies upon the
                 collection, recording, and dissemination of the
                 fundamental printed records of the American
                 Revolution-its precursing events and its aftermath. The
                 Society has done so in the strong belief that the
                 influence of those who controlled the printed word were
                 the persons crucial to the formation of a revolution
                 within the minds of Americans, as well as to the act of
                 overt revolt. Thus, the history of the Society is
                 inextricably linked with the American press and with
                 the American Revolution and has resulted in our
                 enduring interest in the history of printing and
                 publishing of the country. Thomas, himself, established
                 this focus his own lifetime, for his narrative of the
                 contribution of American printers to the development of
                 our cultural life during the seventeenth and eighteenth
                 centuries is, after 167 years, still informative, and
                 it remains in print. Thomas also compiled the first
                 list of American imprints of the colonial period, which
                 was edited and published by the Society in 1874.
                 Succeeding Society members and staff have followed our
                 founder by actively enlarging knowledge of the American
                 printed record and, through its interpretation,
                 expanding our understanding of American history and
                 culture. Thus, this book of essays falls squarely
                 within the traditional concerns of the Society and we
                 trust it serves to deepen our understanding of the role
                 of the printers during the Revolution. Isaiah Thomas
                 provides a link between the press, the Revolution, and
                 this Society, a link that may serve to introduce this
                 volume.",

                 Fenway, a typeface designed by Matthew Carter in 1998
                 for Sports Illustrated magazine. The design of Fenway
                 was inspired by the types of two illustrious
                 punchcutters who worked for the Ensched{\'e} Type
                 Foundry at Harlem in the Netherlands: Johann Michael
                 Fleischmann (1701--1768) and Jean Fran{\c{c}}ois Rosart
                 (1714--1774). The custom version of Fenway used in this
                 book was developed in OpenType format, by John Hudson
                 of Tiro Typeworks, Vancouver, BC. Fenway's character
                 set was significantly expanded to accommodate the
                 numerous special sorts necessary for the typesetting of
                 this book --- many of these additions to the original
                 font complement were created by the originator of
                 Fenway, Matthew Carter, at the request of the book
                 production team. Fonts belonging to the Vincent family
                 --- Vincent Medium, Vincent Display, and Vincent Banner
                 Drop --- have been used for all display elements in
                 this book's essay section, its front and back matter
                 (for larger size headings, titles, initial capitals),
                 and also its cover. Vincent, designed by Matthew Carter
                 in 1996 was first used in Newsweek magazine in 1999.
                 Vincent's design is based on early type of Vincent
                 Figgins (1776--1844), an English punchcutter whose
                 foundry remained in operation until 1908. PT New Letter
                 Gothic has been used for the typesetting of the text
                 and headings in the bukva:raz! section of this book. PT
                 New Letter Gothic was designed by Gayanch Bagdasaryan
                 for Para-Type, Moscow, in 1999. Its design is based on
                 Letter Gothic, a typeface originally developed by Roger
                 Robertson in 1956--1962 as a single-weight, monospaced

                 practices of Zainer during his first five years of
                 operation in Ulm. The 1470s were a vital period in the
                 development of printing --- new practitioners were
                 taking up the trade and, as they did so, adapting
                 existing methods and developing new ones. The two-pull
                 press was introduced during this decade in most
                 European centres. Zainer is a particularly good choice
                 for this examination as he was a careless printer who
                 left many traces on his pages, traces which today would
                 be termed printer's errors, and which have left a rich
                 trail for the printing detective to follow. From her
                 discoveries about Zainer's practices Dr Bolton has been
                 able to track back to the work of earlier printers, as
                 well as to compare editions printed by some of his
                 contemporaries, thus providing new evidence and a

                 70s. This history takes an inclusive view of the varied

                 confused acknowledgment from the art world that has
                 long marginalized the artist's book. The book
                 identifies European precursors of these kinds of
                 artists' books, then quickly moves to America with the
                 development of artists and books and non-profit
                 organizations. No Longer Innocent also addresses the

                 and, in the classical typography of his later career,
                 perhaps the first typographic postmodernist. Active
                 literature is a close study of his modernist years,
                 based on extensive research in the archives and

                 particular emphasis on Tschichold as a propagandist of
                 New Typography, through his many books and articles,
                 showing that he was as much an explainer as a designer.

                 between colleagues across Europe in the turbulent years
                 of the Nazi ascent to power. The book is introduced

                 reformer and a major force behind the arts and crafts

                 British artistic and cultural life at the turn of the
                 last century. Inspired by the Romantic
                 anti-industrialism of John Ruskin and William Morris,
                 Ashbee started a small craft workshop in the East End
                 of London in 1888 called the Guild of Handicraft; he
                 not only made it a place where work could be satisfying
                 and creative but in 1902, in the boldest gesture of his
                 career, he moved the Guild's workshops out to the
                 idyllic Cotswold town of Chipping Campden. Utilising
                 the often vivid journals kept by Ashbee and his wife
                 Janet, Alan Crawford documents Ashbee's life and work,
                 the story of the Guild and the part Ashbee played in
                 reform movements that ranged from the conservation of
                 historic buildings to early town planning.",

  abstract =     "This book is the first full-length study to look into
                 John Day's life and legacy. Scholars have paid much
                 attention of late to the Acts and Monuments but without
                 placing it within the context of Day's overall business
                 strategy. In order to understand both the man and his
                 business, as Evenden shows, we must look at the wider
                 range of Day's productions and the motivation behind
                 them. The study begins by setting Day in the context of
                 the sixteenth-century printing industry, examining his
                 disputed origins and his establishment as a London
                 printer. A number of Day's most celebrated Elizabethan
                 productions are then discussed in detail, in order to
                 understand not only his business strategies but also
                 his religious and political affiliations throughout
                 this period; similarly, Evenden examines his
                 connections with the Stranger communities in London,
                 and how they assisted Day's business and helped to
                 enhance his reputation. Throughout the book it is
                 argued that Day's printing empire and wealth were
                 founded on a combination of two crucial factors:
                 outstanding technical skills, and the ability to
                 attract patrons and patents.",

                 jackets during the first century of their use. From the
                 earliest known jacket issued in 1819, the author
                 surveys the entire field of British, American, and
                 European jackets and documents a part of publishing
                 history that was nearly lost to the nineteenth-century
                 custom of discarding dust-jackets so that the more
                 decorative bindings could be seen. The book examines
                 when and why publishers began to issue dust-jackets,
                 the subsequent growth of their use, and the role they
                 played in marketing. Included are the rare
                 all-enclosing jackets that were issued on some annuals
                 and trade books, ornate Victorian jackets, binders' and
                 stationers' jackets, and many others. A chapter on
                 Lewis Carroll's jackets includes letters he wrote to
                 his publisher on the subject, which are published here

                 content of bookplates has evolved over the years to
                 feature a vast range of allegory and symbolism.

                 comparatively recently has it been widely accepted as
                 material for academic study This book is new in that it
                 discusses ephemera as an aspect of design history,
                 showing how function, process and period have effected
                 the changing appearance of billheads, trade cards,
                 flyers, playbills and other ephemera. Ideas travelled
                 in both directions across the Atlantic. American
                 founders devised wholly original new typefaces and
                 these were imported into Britain; yet the development
                 of expertise in designing with these new faces depended
                 on printers learning from one another, and the first
                 scheme of specimen exchange that successfully achieved
                 this was wholly devised and administered from London.
                 Richly illustrated with letterforms, engravings,
                 drawings and the reproduction of over 250 items of
                 ephemera, this is a book for collectors, students,

                 Van den Keere, Briot, Van Dyck, Kis, Fournier, Rosart,
                 Gille, Didot and many other masters from the fifteenth
                 to the nineteenth century. Since the Plantin-Moretus
                 printing office acquired most of the specimens when
                 new, moreover, the collection as a whole tells a story
                 in a way that collections assembled piecemeal in the
                 nineteenth and twentieth centuries cannot. Finally, the
                 Museum's archives help to document the origins of many
                 specimens. This first detailed catalogue of the
                 Museum's specimens reports the styles and sizes of type
                 shown, describes the structures and paper stocks, notes
                 relations with other specimens in the collection and
                 elsewhere, and provides references to literature on
                 many of the individual types shown. Preliminary notes
                 on the type founders and printers who issued the
                 specimens include chronologies of the foundries and
                 information on the origins of their materials,
                 sometimes supplemented with information about the
                 history of the firms and the genealogy of the founders.
                 Nearly all of the nineteen specimens illustrated at
                 their original size appear here for the first time, and
                 extensive indexes make this book a powerful reference

  abstract =     "The book and type designer Frederic Warde is
                 remembered today chiefly for his collaboration with
                 Stanley Morison, for producing the singular typeface
                 Arrighi, and for being, briefly, the husband of
                 Beatrice, Monotype's charismatic publicity manager. His
                 life was short (he died in 1939, at the age of only
                 forty-five) but in the previous two decades he had
                 pursued a peripatetic, rollercoaster career that saw
                 him come into contact with most of the leading players
                 in his field, in England, Europe, and America: Bruce
                 Rogers, Mardersteig, Updike, Ruzicka, George Macy,
                 William Kittredge, and, of course, Morison, are just a
                 few of a stellar cast of characters whose lives
                 intersected with his orbit. Until now scantily
                 documented, Warde is the missing piece in the story of
                 design, type, and printing in the interwar years, and
                 this book will make essential reading for anyone
                 interested in that critical period, one that saw the
                 final era of hot-metal composition and printing
                 combined with the emergence of graphic design as a
                 distinct profession. Warde laid many false trails about
                 his personal history, but the author has drawn upon a
                 surprisingly large body of surviving documentation to
                 piece together a fascinating picture of his life and of
                 the complex, frustrating, sometimes dislikeable, but
                 often inspiring, figure at its center. The best of
                 Warde's extensive body of work displays a restraint and
                 economy linked with an often striking color sense that
                 feels thoroughly modern in its approach. This output
                 was maintained, sometimes erratically, against the
                 backdrop of Warde's mercurial and fragmented
                 professional and personal life. Polarizing the opinions
                 of those he met, he was unfailingly a prolific,
                 entertaining, and informed letter writer, and his
                 correspondence provides invaluable insights into his
                 world and those around him. Here is a designer's life
                 played out against the backdrop of the boom years of
                 the 1920s, the challenges of the Depression, and the
                 obstacles and opportunities created by his own
                 remarkable, but troubled, genius.",

                 designers, ranging from poets like Gabriel Dante
                 Rossetti and Stephane Mallarme, from artists like James
                 McNeil Whistler and Eugene Grasset, and from binders
                 like T. J. Cobden-Sanderson and Marius Michel, sought
                 to craft book designs that were beautiful but also

  abstract =     "In this fascinating tour through typographic history,
                 Paul Shaw provides a visually rich exploration of
                 digital type revival. Many typefaces from the
                 pre-digital past have been reinvented for use on
                 computers and mobile devices, while other new font
                 designs are revivals of letterforms, drawn from
                 inscriptions, calligraphic manuals, posters, and book
                 jackets. Revival Type deftly introduces these fonts,
                 many of which are widely used, and engagingly tells
                 their stories. Examples include translations of
                 letterforms not previously used as type, direct
                 revivals of metal and wood typefaces, and looser
                 interpretations of older fonts. Among these are
                 variations on classic designs by John Baskerville,
                 Giambattista Bodoni, William Caslon, Firmin Didot,
                 Claude Garamont, Robert Granjon, and Nicolas Jenson, as
                 well as typefaces inspired by less familiar designers,
                 including Richard Austin, Philippe Grandjean, and
                 Eudald Pradell. Updates and revisions of 20th-century
                 classics such as Palatino, Meridien, DIN, Metro, and
                 Neue Haas Grotesk (Helvetica) are also discussed.
                 Handsomely illustrated with annotated examples,
                 archival material depicting classic designs, and full
                 character sets of modern typefaces, Revival Type is an
                 essential introduction for designers and design
                 enthusiasts into the process of reinterpreting
                 historical type.",

  abstract =     "In the mid-1980s --- with the widespread adoption of
                 the personal computer and small laser printers, with
                 the introduction of cheap software packages for making
                 pages and typefaces --- a revolution in typography was
                 set in train. Among several unforeseen consequences was
                 an overthrow of the old way of making typefaces: the
                 initiative passed from the old industrially-based
                 companies to small, often one- or two-person outfits.
                 Now we are far enough into this new era to begin to
                 make an assessment. The first part of this book is a
                 personal statement. Fred Smeijers considers the gains
                 and also the illusions and pitfalls of technical
                 advance. Bringing a deep historical awareness to bear
                 on the topic, he puts this brief recent phase into
                 perspective. Along the way are sharp remarks on the
                 place of the designer in the social world, on the
                 question of copying and copyright. This realistic view
                 brings high-flown pretensions down to earth, yet puts
                 forward a more solid and enduring vision. Smeijers ends
                 this modest manifesto with a new code of conduct for
                 designers. The second part of the book presents
                 Smeijers's own work as a type designer and graphic
                 designer, over twenty years. It shows all his types and
                 fonts, including several that have until now been
                 hidden from public view, and includes the designer's
                 own narrative of his work so far. The book has been
                 made in connection with the award to Fred Smeijers of
                 the Gorrit Noordzij Prize, in recognition of his
                 contribution as a designer, teacher, and writer.",

                 delivery at his bookshop at the sign of the Black Bear
                 near St. Paul's of a book that had been long in the
                 making. Master William Shakespeare's Comedies,
                 Histories, and Tragedies was the first collected
                 edition of Shakespeare's plays, appearing some seven
                 years after their author's death in 1616. Its 950 folio
                 pages included thirty-six plays, half of which had not
                 previously been printed, divided under the three
                 generic headings of the title. There was no fanfare at
                 the book's arrival. There was nothing of the marketing
                 overdrive that marks an important new publication in
                 our own period: no advertising campaign, no reviews,
                 interviews, endorsements or literary prizes, no queues
                 in St Paul's Churchyard, no sales figures, price war,
                 copycat publications or bestseller lists --- in short,
                 no sensation. Nevertheless, it is hard to overstate the
                 importance of this literary, cultural and commercial
                 moment. This book, generously illustrated with key
                 pages from the publication and comparative works, tells
                 the human, artistic, economic and technical stories of
                 the birth of the First Folio -- and the birth of

                 first reference work of its kind covering the broad
                 concept of the book throughout the world from ancient
                 to modern times. Along with such subjects as
                 bibliography, the history of printing, editorial theory
                 and practice, and textual criticism, it also engages
                 with newer disciplines such as the history of the book
                 and the electronic book. Additionally, the companion
                 provides an engaging analysis of how books and
                 societies have shaped one another. Written by the
                 world's top scholars in bibliography and book history,
                 the companion is an authoritative and highly
                 informative work of reference for an international
                 readership across a vast range of disciplines. This
                 unique two-volume work is organized into two parts.
                 Part I is a substantial series of introductory essays
                 --- over forty essays offer generic histories of the
                 subject as well as surveys of the history of the book
                 around the world, including the Muslim world, Asia,
                 Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Part II of the
                 companion comprises an A--Z section of over 5,000
                 entries on every aspect of this exceptionally rich and
                 diverse subject, ranging from brief definitions and
                 biographical entries to more extensive treatments. Both
                 parts of the text are richly illustrated with
                 reproductions, diagrams, maps, and examples of various
                 typographical features.",

                 changed the way we view the natural world. At the end
                 of the eighteenth century Britain fell in love with
                 nature. Two books marked this moment --- Gilbert
                 White's Natural History of Selborne and Thomas Bewick's
                 History of British Birds, the first 'field guide' for
                 ordinary people, illustrated by woodcuts of astonishing
                 accuracy and beauty. In the vivid vignettes scattered
                 through his book Bewick drew the life of the country
                 people of the north-east, children and farmers,
                 travelling musicians, old, soldiers and beggars,
                 housewives and fishermen --- a world already vanishing
                 under the threat of enclosures. In this illustrated
                 life, Jenny Uglow tells the story of the farmer's son
                 from Tyneside who never courted fame yet revolutionised
                 wood engraving and influenced book illustration for a
                 century to come. It is a story of violent change and
                 radical politics of Newcastle and the Tyne, workshops
                 and family life, mines and fells, the sea and the
                 fierce west winds --- a journey into a past whose
                 energy and power still haunt us today, and the

                 for the first time the nature of Ricketts's
                 collaboration with the master printer Charles McCall of
                 the Ballantyne Press and the degree to which Ricketts's
                 success, both artistic and commercial, depended upon
                 the transformation of his redundant skill as a wood
                 engraver into a positive medium of artistic expression.
                 This work offers a historic window into the world of
                 Ricketts, his contemporaries, and the British fine
                 press movement. Readers will also find this history
                 well-illustrated in colour and black and white with a
                 comprehensive bibliography of the works of the Vale
                 Press and Ricketts.",
